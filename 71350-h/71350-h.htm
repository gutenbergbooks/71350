<h3>
PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION
</h3>

<p>
Since the first appearance of this book,
a very important event has occurred in
the history of Hadrian's Wall.  It has
been definitely recognized as a monument of national
importance, to be scheduled and protected under
the authority of the Office of Works.  This means
that owners and occupiers of the lands over which
it extends will be powerless to interfere with it,
unless by the authority of the Department, and
that they will be liable for the repair of any damage
that may be done to it.
</p>

<p>
It is not too much to say that this marks the
greatest epoch in the history of the Wall since, at
the end of the fourth century, it ceased to be
garrisoned, and was allowed to fall into disrepair.
Neglect or wanton destruction fell to its share for
fourteen hundred years.  Now the Office of Works
has set the seal on the tireless efforts of Mr. John
Clayton and Dr. Collingwood Bruce, who would
indeed have rejoiced to see this day.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Important discoveries have been made at several
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
points along the line of the Wall during the last
three years.
</p>

<p>
The site of the fort at Burgh-by-sands was
definitely located by Mr. W. G. Collingwood,
F.S.A., and Mr. R. G. Collingwood, F.S.A., in 1922.
Since 1903, when the main road was "up" for
drainage purposes and no Roman remains were
found, the very existence of the fort had been
questioned.
</p>

<p>
But excavation has resulted in the discovery of
the east gate, lying just north of Hadrian's Wall,
on the edge of the main road, which represents
roughly the <i>via principalis</i>.  Stone barrack-buildings
were also traced, running north and south,
and the fort was proved to have lain across the
line of Hadrian's Wall, as did Cilurnum.  The
main road is a cutting, below the level of any
Roman remains.  The stones of some of the fort
walls had rotted so completely that the spade cut
quite through them, and thus my scepticism about
"perishing stones" in the neighbourhood was
rebuked (p. 207).  The Church at Burgh probably
occupies the site of one of the central buildings,
perhaps of a granary, the massive stones from
which would be very handy for the Church-builders.
</p>

<p>
Hadrian's Wall was found to join the main road
a little to the east of the Vicarage, from which
point the road is laid partly on the Wall's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvii"></a>vii}</span>
foundations, and partly on its berm, up to the junction
of Wall and fort.
</p>

<p>
A site known as Old Castle, about 200 yards
eastward from the fort, marks the position of
the mediæval castle of Sir Hugh de Morville,
built, no doubt, of stones from the Wall and
fort.  The remains of a small Roman bridge,
which carried the Military Way over the Powburgh
Beck, are to be seen some 300 yards east of the
Old Castle.
</p>

<p>
At Rudchester, Mr. Parker Brewis, F.S.A., has
directed excavations of the fort of Vindobala.  It
was found to be similar in plan to Cilurnum, lying
across the Wall, and with six gates.  Three out of
the five chambers of the headquarters buildings
were uncovered, including the Chapel of the
Standards with the treasury beneath; and there
was also found the largest granary yet known in
the north of England.
</p>

<p>
Both portals of the double west gate, and also
the west portal of the south gate, were found to
have been built up as early as the middle of the
second century.
</p>

<p>
The Excavation Committee of the Society of
Antiquaries of Newcastle-on-Tyne, appointed in
February 1924, has been enlarged into "The North
of England Excavation Committee," which hopes to
open up other sites on the Wall during 1925, with
Mr. Parker Brewis still as Director.  A detailed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pviii"></a>viii}</span>
report of the work at Rudchester will shortly be
published.
</p>

<p>
Below Birdoswald, Dr. R. C. Shaw, of Manchester
University, is, as I write, completing the excavation
of the bridge over the Irthing, referred to on <a href="#P163">page
163</a>.  No trace has been discovered of any western
abutment, and it has therefore presumably been
washed away by the strong current of the river;
but on the eastern side a whole series of abutments
has been uncovered.  The course of the river is
now much farther west than it was in Roman times,
and it was evidently necessary in their day to
rebuild the abutments farther and farther west as
the river receded in that direction.
</p>

<p>
The remains of these abutments are most
impressive, and Hadrian's Wall has been found
standing up to nine courses of stones.
</p>

<p>
The stages of the work appear to be as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I.  A very interesting feature, and one likely to
give rise to much discussion, is the discovery of a
10-foot thick wall, of earlier date than the Great
Wall, and ending in an abutment which is also
10 feet thick.  The bridge starting from this
abutment could only have been wide enough to carry
the rampart-walk.  Farther inland this wall has
been found to a height of one or two courses of stone
above the foundations.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
II.  Here a wall of superior masonry, of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pix"></a>ix}</span>
character usually associated with Hadrian's Wall,
has been built, 7½ feet wide, on the lower courses
of the earlier wall, the original wall having been
allowed to remain near the water.  The new wall
was found to be accompanied by a road about
14 feet wide, which was carried up to an abutment
of large masonry blocks&mdash;re-used material,
apparently taken from the breastwork of the earlier
abutment.  The road has a gravel surface and a
foundation of cobbles.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
III.  A tower, larger than the one at Chesters,
was built on the top of the aforesaid road-abutment.
Of its two floor-levels, the earlier, of clay, was
Hadrianic or Antonine, later than the Wall, and
earlier than the late Antonine rising.  The second
floor, of sand, was also probably second century,
the two floors agreeing approximately with what
are known as the 1<i>a</i>and 1<i>b</i> levels.
</p>

<p>
A new length of wall, westwards towards the
river, was added when the tower was built, the
abutment was reconstructed, and buttressed on
the south side by a massive tapering breastwork.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
IV.  Possibly a rectangular abutment was added
to the face of the tapering breastwork, but this
phase is not yet clear.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
V.  A very massive curved abutment and a
Water-pier, with stone pavement between them, were
constructed still farther west, forming an open
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Px"></a>x}</span>
sluice.  The character of this work suggests the
time of Severus or later in the third century.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
VI.  The open sluice was filled with gravel and
stones, sealed down with a layer of lime; probably
in the fourth century.
</p>

<p>
Since the work is still in progress, these notes
can only indicate the stage reached up to 17th
November 1924.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dr. Shaw has also excavated two Wall-turrets,
one behind the byre of Willowford farm-house,
which has been left uncovered, and another nearer
Gilsland.  The Wall was found to have been
thickened to 10 feet in width in the neighbourhood
of the turrets.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The question has often been raised as to whether
it is better to walk the Wall from east to west (as
I did) or from west to east.  I am an "East-to-Wester"
all the time.  It is far pleasanter to end
the walk on the seashore of a picturesque
fishing-village than in the smoky suburbs of a great
industrial city.
</p>

<p>
And has not the trend of humanity always been
westward? ... "A kind of <i>heavenly</i> destiny,"
says Wordsworth in his "Stepping Westward."
</p>

<p>
It is almost certain that the Romans worked
westward in building the Wall.  As their first
fine enthusiasm began perhaps to wane, they found
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxi"></a>xi}</span>
it necessary to call in the help of tribes from Devon
and Cornwall, and from near London, and also of
men of the fleet.  Inscribed stones have been found
at Netherby near Carlisle, and at Triermain near
Birdoswald, giving evidence that men of the <i>Classis
Britannica</i> worked on the Wall at the western end;
and other stones, at Holmhead and at Howgill,
give the names of two southern tribes, the Dumnonii
and the Catuvellauni, suggesting that they also
helped at this end.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Following Dr. Collingwood Bruce, I have called
the road from Newcastle to Carlisle "Wade's
Road."  This is a mistake, for General Wade died in 1748,
as his monument in Westminster Abbey shows,
and the road was not made until 1753.  The Act of
Parliament authorizing it was passed in 1750.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I must add a few words about
the purpose of the Wall.  On <a href="#P23">page 23</a>, I have said:
"No one ever doubts what it was meant to be or
to do."  This is true, in the sense that the Wall, in
its perfect condition, would cry aloud to all comers,
"Thus far and no farther."  It was essentially a
<i>barrier</i>.  But the old idea that it was intended to
be used as a <i>fighting-ground</i> is exploded.  It had
been built two centuries before the Romans could
have practised bow-and-arrow warfare, such as
Kipling describes in "Puck of Pook's Hill."  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
auxiliaries were then armed only with the usual
short sword and heavy throwing-spear, quite
unsuitable weapons for warfare from a wall; and
the width of the Wall was insufficient for the use of
catapults and ballistæ.
</p>

<p>
No; the Wall was an elevated sentry-walk, a
continuous look-out tower; it was a guarantee
that no one could enter Roman territory without
Roman permission.  When the sentries on the Wall
gave warning of an attack from the north, the
cohorts from the forts would not line up on the
Wall; they would fling wide the northern gates,
and march out to meet the enemy in the open.  The
whole question is very interestingly discussed in an
article on "The Purpose of the Roman Wall," by
Mr. R. G. Collingwood, in No. VIII. of <i>The Vasculum</i>.

<h3>
INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "You never can bring in a Wall.<br>
  Some man or other must present Wall."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The idea of a colour-book on Hadrian's
Wall was suggested to me by friends in
1914.  Then came the Great War, blotting
out all thought of work of this kind.
</p>

<p>
But in 1920 I was taken by these friends along
the line of the Wall, and I soon fell a victim to its
many attractions.  My friends went home; but I
found hospitality at the farms and other houses in
the neighbourhood, and began to paint at once.
</p>

<p>
Before long I decided to "walk the Wall" every
foot of the way, 73½ miles, from sea to sea, being
inspired thereto by the example and the record of
William Hutton.  Many of my readers will need
an introduction to this delightful character, whose
book&mdash;to which I shall often have occasion to
refer&mdash;is now out of print.
</p>

<p>
William Hutton was an archæologist of Birmingham,
who in 1801, at the age of seventy-eight,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxiv"></a>xiv}</span>
travelled alone and on foot "six hundred miles to
see a shattered Wall."
</p>

<p>
He then published an account of the Wall and
the walk, written in a very original and interesting
style, although, as he tells us, "the <i>Battledore</i>, at
an age not exceeding six, was the last book I used
at school."
</p>

<p>
"The respectable and amiable Author" (to use
the words of contemporary critics) started from
Birmingham with his daughter; but since she rode
on a pillion behind a servant, and he went on foot,
they can hardly be said to have "accompanied"
each other.  They used to meet at the inns, for
dinner, bed and breakfast; and at Penrith they
parted, she making her way to Keswick and the
Lakes, he to Carlisle and his beloved Wall.
</p>

<p>
He sent his daughter two notes during his Wall
journey: the first from Carlisle, in which he said
he was sound in body, shoe and stocking, and had
just risen from a lodging among fleas; the second,
from Newcastle, when he wrote (to quote her words)
"that he had been at the Wall's End; that the
weather was so hot he was obliged to repose under
hedges; and that the country was infested with
thieves: but, lest I should be under any
apprehensions for his personal safety, he added they
were only such as demolished his idol, the Wall,
by stealing the stones of which it was composed."
</p>

<p>
Of his aim in writing his book, he thus speaks:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxv"></a>xv}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I would enliven truth with the smile, with the
anecdote; and while I travel the long and dreary
Wall, would have you travel with me, though by
your own fireside; would have you see and feel
as I do; and make the journey influence your
passions as mine are influenced."
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that his enthusiasm is
infectious, and that whoever follows the Wall in the
same spirit as he did, will not find it a "long and
dreary" journey.
</p>

<p>
For myself, I was fascinated by it; I enjoyed
every step of the way; and the pictures of the
Wall which are here reproduced are the fruit of
many happy days spent in its company.
</p>

<p>
Owing to present conditions, the original idea of
a colour-book was dropped, for something more
portable and less costly, so the number of
illustrations in colour is limited to six, instead of the
twenty-five I had prepared; and of the remaining
nineteen, only eight appear in monochrome.
</p>

<p>
In one sense I did not walk the Wall alone.  I
had two companions, William Hutton and
Dr. Collingwood Bruce.  The latter was represented
by his <i>Handbook</i> on the Wall, which was first
published in 1863, and which has proved its value
by having appeared, in seven successive editions,
as the standard work on the subject.  Dr. Bruce
and Mr. John Clayton will always be remembered as
the great pioneers of practical research on the Wall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvi"></a>xvi}</span>
</p>

<p>
I owe much to the kindness of Mr. F. Gerald
Simpson, who hopes to return to active work on
the Wall next year (at Birdoswald), and who is my
authority on many points in the archæology of the
Wall which his recent excavations have brought to
light.  Much is waiting to be done, but the adequate
prosecution of the work in the future will depend
entirely on how much financial help is forthcoming
from those interested in historical research.
</p>

<p>
I was very fortunate in falling in with the Three
Days' Pilgrimage of the Society of Antiquaries of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the Cumberland and
Westmorland Archæological Society, and in being
allowed to join it, in September 1920; and I
have to thank the members for their kind welcome
to a stranger, and for their readiness to help me.
In this connection I must specially mention
Mrs. T. H. Hodgson, Mr. Robert Blair, F.S.A., and
Mr. W. G. Collingwood, F.S.A.
</p>

<p>
<i>Archæologia Æliana</i>, issued yearly by the Society
of Antiquaries of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and the
annual <i>Transactions</i> of the Cumberland and
Westmorland Antiquarian and Archæological Society
have been of the greatest service as works of
reference.  To the former I am also indebted for the
plans of the Roman Bridge and of Cilurnum and
Borcovicium (Figs. 6, 8, and 12).
</p>

<p>
From the work entitled <i>Romano-British Buildings
and Earthworks</i>, by the late Mr. John Ward,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvii"></a>xvii}</span>
F.S.A., the author and the publishers (Messrs. Methuen
&amp; Co.) have kindly allowed me to take
Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14.
</p>

<p>
Readers who wish to study the latest discoveries
with regard to the Vallum will find them in the
recently published <i>The Purpose and Date of the
Vallum and its Crossings</i>, by Mr. F. Gerald Simpson
and Dr. R. C. Shaw (Titus Wilson, Kendal).  It
forms part of vol. xxii. of the Transactions of the
Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and
Archæological Society, but it can also be obtained
separately.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For those who do not care to walk all the way,
and who wish to see a great deal of the Wall in a
short time, the George Inn at Chollerford makes
a delightful centre.  It stands on the bank of the
North Tyne, with well-kept gardens sloping down
to the water's edge, just where a five-arched stone
bridge crosses the river.  The bridge dates from
1771, the year when every bridge over the Tyne
except the one at Corbridge was swept away by
heavy floods.
</p>

<p>
Chollerford is only 21 miles by road from
Newcastle, and the road runs on the Wall foundations
nearly all the way.  The little station of
Humshaugh, on the branch-line from Hexham, is quite
close to the <i>George</i>.
</p>

<p>
For motorists an excellent plan is to make the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxviii"></a>xviii}</span>
<i>George</i> their headquarters and thence to visit the
Fort of Cilurnum at Walwick Chesters.  Then to
travel by car along Wade's Road, noting the points
of interest <i>en route</i>, until the entrance to
Housesteads (Borcovicium) is reached.  Here the car
must be left and the fort examined.  The walk
thence along the mural ridge can be made long or
short according to inclination.  Tracks run down
to Wade's Road at frequent intervals&mdash;at Milking
Gap, Peel, Caw Gap and Pilgrims' Gap (by the
Haltwhistle Burn).  From Borcovicium to Pilgrims'
Gap would be a walk of nearly 6 miles along
the Wall ridge; so for those who do not care to
walk so far on rough ground, a better plan would
be to send the car on to Bradley farm-house and
to descend to the road by Milking Gap; travel
by car to Peel and examine the fine remains of Wall
there; return to the car for another 2½ miles
along Wade's Road, and then walk up by the
Haltwhistle Burn to examine the Cawfields mile-castle
and the Wall in its neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
Gilsland is the best centre for visiting, not only
the Fort of Amboglanna, at Birdoswald, but also
the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall and Thirlwall Castle,
and the site of the Fort of Magna at Carvoran.
There is very good accommodation at Gilsland.
From Birdoswald, cars can travel actually on the
line of the Wall as far as the village of Banks,
near which, at Hare Hill, the highest piece of Wall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxix"></a>xix}</span>
yet standing is to be seen.  The road journey can
be continued past Lanercost Priory through
Brampton to Carlisle, whence road and Wall run close
together, for the most part, all the way to Bowness,
where the Wall ends; but only the pedestrian
can examine it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Those who prefer to travel by train can easily
visit the Wall in sections, making Hexham,
Gilsland and Carlisle their headquarters.  On the line
between Newcastle and Carlisle, Fourstones is the
station for visiting Cilurnum; Haydon Bridge for
Sewingshields; Bardon Mill for Vindolanda and
Borcovicium; Haltwhistle for Æsica and
Winshields; Greenhead for Thirlwall Castle and the
Nine Nicks; Gilsland for Amboglanna; and Naworth
for Lanercost and Banks.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
THE MESSAGE OF THE WALL
</h3>

<p class="t3">
"<i>Forma mentis æterna.</i>"&mdash;TACITUS.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There is no doubt that this great Roman
Wall, from Tyne to Solway, this mighty
relic of a mighty people, gains a wonderful
hold on the affections of those who follow its
course, stirring the imagination and quickening
the pulses in a way that could hardly be expected
from a mere crumbling ruin.  All who have learnt
to know and to love it will admit this; it unites
them all in one common bond; though built to
place a barrier between the dwellers of the north
and the south, certainly nowadays it draws many
of them closer together!  What is the secret of
this attraction?  The fact that the Wall is the
mightiest antiquity of Britain is not of itself
sufficient to account for the glamour it sheds.  We
must seek a more subtle reason; and the true
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
source of its attraction is that it stands for a great
ideal.
</p>

<p>
As we follow it in its unfaltering course from sea
to sea, and mark how bravely it has withstood
the ravages of time and the hand of the destroyer,
it dawns upon us that it stands for something
permanent, something eternal, something in the
very nature of man which can never die.  We see
that these stones, of Wall, and Fort, and Castle,
are signs of the strength and endurance, the
discipline, obedience and devotion to duty of the men
who conceived the whole idea, and of the men who
carried out the conception.
</p>

<p>
Although it is now definitely ascertained that
Hadrian built the Wall, yet we must go back to
Agricola for the source of the inspiration.  It was
he who laid the foundations of a righteous Roman
rule in Britain.  It was he who saw that the petty
chieftains of the southern parts must be educated
to sink their differences, and to unite in allegiance
to the Roman Empire.  It was he who, by his
own disinterested and unselfish conduct, gave to
the British chiefs an example of public-spirited
loyalty to principle which was a thousand times
more valuable than precept.
</p>

<p>
And it was he who built the first line of Forts
from Tyne to Solway.
</p>

<p>
As I followed the Wall, this was the refrain
which repeated itself over and over again in my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
ears, and echoed in the streets of the deserted
forts: these words of Tacitus which form part of
the tribute paid by a distinguished son to his
distinguished father:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "Only the fashion of the soul remains."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yes, the Wall is a ruin; the "defenced cities"
have become "heaps"; and the might and glory
of Rome have long been laid in the dust; but the
great and good qualities of men like Agricola and
Hadrian shine down the ages, and remain a source
of inspiration and of strength for ever.
</p>

<p>
Agricola was the finer character, and he had
the advantage of escaping the temptations which
imperial dignities bring; but in Hadrian, also, we
see that devotion to a sense of duty, that clear
perception of justice, that wisdom in administration,
which are of the qualities that endure, and
leave their mark on future ages.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "Only the fashion of the soul remains."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The aim of both Agricola and Hadrian was to
convert Britain into a peaceful and self-governed
Roman province.  Their incentive was the love of
an ideal.  Each had a vision of stability and unity;
but whereas Agricola's direct endeavour was to
absorb and Romanize the whole island, Hadrian
chose to consolidate rather than to extend.  In
helping the Britons south of the Wall line to keep
out the raiding Caledonians, and encouraging them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
to settle down, undisturbed, to peaceful agricultural
and industrial pursuits, he hoped that in time the
leaven of this higher ideal would spread north to
the farthest limits of the island.
</p>

<p>
And with this aim the Wall was built.
</p>

<p>
In all ages the building of walls has marked a
stage of advance in the evolution of human character,
in so far as it has meant a progress from the offensive
to the defensive position.
</p>

<p>
In ancient Persia, the great reformer Zarathusthra
condemned the raiding lives of the nomads,
and held up the purer ideal of a peaceable and
industrious community, dwelling within walls, and
living on the fruit of their labour.  Tradition says
that he was slain by a resentful nomad on the
steps of a temple, and thus he gave his life for
his ideal.
</p>

<p>
History repeats itself.  Persia, China, Greece
and Rome all built walls of brick or stone to keep
out the enemy, and maintain the stability of their
respective empires.  Each had an ideal of unity
to achieve, and sought in this way to promote it.
</p>

<p>
In our own day, unity is still the ideal.  Have
we made a great advance over the methods of our
predecessors?
</p>

<p>
Rome had great qualities, great and good men;
yet she fell.  What did she lack?  She has left us
shining examples of strength, endurance, courage,
justice and devotion to duty.  Where did she fail?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
</p>

<p>
She lacked just what we lack ourselves: the
<i>true idea</i> of unity, the true ideal of universal love,
without which all other greatness "profiteth
nothing."
</p>

<p>
Are we just beginning to learn that the true
"walls" which can alone preserve any nation or
empire from destruction or decay, and which do
indeed ensure its stability, are not walls of brick
or stone, not armies, Dreadnoughts, aeroplanes
nor submarines, but great moral and spiritual
qualities, high aspirations, an ideal of unity which
views the whole world as one, faced by one common
enemy, and sees that, with the nation as with the
individual, true greatness consists in humility and
willingness to serve?
</p>

<p>
"Violence shall no more be heard in thy land,
wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but
thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates
Praise."
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "Only the fashion of the soul remains."<br>
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
HISTORICAL
</h3>

<p>
In studying the Wall it is well to refresh our
memory of Roman history wherever it relates
to Britain, to sit in our mental "picture-house"
as it were, and let scene after scene flit
by us on the screen.
</p>

<p>
First, in 55 B.C., we see Julius Cæsar, as governor
of Gaul, arriving to punish the interfering islanders
of Britain for the help they had given to the Gallic
tribes in their resistance to him; meeting with
little success, and so withdrawing, only to return
again the following year, with five legions instead
of two.  Then we see the British king, Cassivelaunus,
whose capital was where St. Albans now
stands, uniting with hostile neighbours to meet the
common foe.  We see him fixing sharp stakes in
the bed of the Thames at the only fordable point,
in a vain attempt to check the Roman legions;
which stakes were still to be seen in the river-bed
seventy years ago, and are probably there still.
</p>

<p>
The next picture shows Cæsar's return to Gaul
in the same year, taking with him British hostages,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
to ensure the payment of tribute, and exhibiting
as a trophy a corslet of British pearls.
</p>

<p>
After this there was what Tacitus calls "a long
forgetfulness of Britain," so far as conquest was
concerned.  He says of Cæsar that "he rather
discovered the island for his descendants than
bequeathed it to them."  For ninety-seven years
there was peaceful communication with Rome, and
the whole island, according to Strabo, became
"intimate and familiar to the Romans."  The
British king, Cunobelin, the Cymbeline of
Shakespeare, was brought up at the Court of Augustus,
and no doubt did something to introduce Roman
laws and customs.  But still the people were as
free as if Cæsar had never landed.
</p>

<p>
Then, in 40 A.D., we see the demented Caligula (or
"Little Boots," the nickname his soldiers gave him)
deciding in a moment of caprice to invade Britain,
but returning after no more than a glance at the
white cliffs of the island, and with sea-shells from
the beach at Boulogne as his only trophy.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor Claudius comes next, in 43 A.D.
Stirred up by discontented British fugitives at
Rome, he sent troops to Britain, under Aulus
Plautius and Vespasian.  When the expedition
succeeded, he came in person, stopping only sixteen
days in the island, but celebrating a stupendous
triumph on his return to Rome.  On the strength
of his victorious campaign, he called his infant son
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
Britannicus, and had the name of Britain stamped
on his coins.
</p>

<p>
Aulus Plautius was the first consular governor
of Britain.  His wife, Pomponia Græcina, was a
Christian.  Was she, perhaps, the first Christian
to land on our shores?
</p>

<p>
Ostorius Scapula succeeded Plautius, and it was
into his hands that the British king, Caradoc (or
Caratacus), the son of Cunobelin, fell, after offering
a brave resistance for at least seven years.
</p>

<p>
Our next picture shows the entry of Caradoc and
his family into Rome, in 50 A.D., as prisoners of war.
The noble bearing of the king alone saved him from
death in the arena.
</p>

<p>
After this the Romans began definitely to colonize
Britain.  Tacitus writes in 97 A.D.: "The nearest
portion of Britain was reduced little by little to the
condition of a province; a colony of veterans was
also planted; certain states were handed over to
King Cogidumnus (who has remained continuously
loyal down to our own times), according to the old
and long-received principle of Roman policy, which
employs kings among the instruments of servitude."
</p>

<p>
Successive governors maintained or extended
Roman authority, until the eastern and southern
portions were so far subdued that the governor,
Suetonius Paulinus, felt able to cross over to Mona
(the island of Anglesey) to bring into subjection
this stronghold of the Druids.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
</p>

<p>
Here was the opportunity of the British tribes,
more restive than they had seemed beneath the
Roman yoke.  Our next picture is a terrible one.
In 61 A.D., seventy thousand persons, "all Romans
or confederates of Rome," were destroyed by the
Iceni, under Queen Boudicca, in the Romanized
towns of Camulodunum, Londinium and Verulam
(Colchester, London and St. Albans).
</p>

<p>
Paulinus returned hastily to the rescue, and "the
fortunes of a single battle restored the country to
its ancient submissiveness."  So says Tacitus;
but it was only a surface submission; the fire was
smouldering, not quenched.
</p>

<p>
A milder governor succeeded Paulinus, and under
him and his successors Roman civilization and
Roman vices began to spread among the Britons.
</p>

<p>
Then came two rulers of sterner type, who
subdued the Brigantes (of Lancashire and the
north-west counties) and the Silures (of South Wales).
</p>

<p>
Following them came Agricola, in 78 A.D., surely
the greatest figure in the history of Roman Britain!
He was appointed governor by the Emperor
Vespasian, the foundations of whose own career
had been laid in Britain.  Agricola, also, had served
his apprenticeship to war in the island, under
Suetonius Paulinus, having passed through the
critical period when the Roman towns were burned
and the populations butchered.
</p>

<p>
His character has been very ably drawn for us
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
by his son-in-law, Tacitus, who shows that the
ideal of true greatness, in those days of imperial
luxury and vice, was as high as our own, and
that there were some who came near to attaining
to it.
</p>

<p>
Unassuming, tactful, patient, incorruptible; kind
and affectionate; brave and energetic, and yet
modest; strictly just, and yet merciful; so great
that it would be an insult to dwell upon his probity
and self-control&mdash;these are some of the qualities
with which Tacitus credits his father-in-law; and
the ability with which he governed Britain goes a
long way towards proving the picture true.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before his arrival in Britain to take up
the reins of government, the tribes of the Ordovices,
of North-west Wales, had crushed almost to a man
the regiment of cavalry encamped amongst them.
Such an incident could not be overlooked by the
new Governor.  Now was the moment to show what
spirit he was of!  Supplementing Roman troops
with native auxiliaries, he marched to the hills
where the Ordovices were hid, and almost
exterminated the whole tribe.
</p>

<p>
"Horrible!" does some one say?  Yes; it was
horrible.  A soldier's devotion to duty always gives
him terrible work to do; and we in this so-called
Christian country can take no superior attitude,
though 1800 years have passed.
</p>

<p>
Agricola then subdued Mona; and having thus
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
established a reputation for courage and firmness
he set himself to the task of making peace more
attractive to the Britons than war.  His intention
was to habituate them to peace and quiet by turning
their thoughts to something better than war, and
therefore he encouraged them to build temples,
houses and market-places.
</p>

<p>
"The rivalry for his compliments took the place
of coercion."  "He began to train the sons of the
chieftains in a liberal education, and to give a
preference to the native talents of the Briton as
against the plodding Gaul."  But he did not neglect
military tactics.  "Time was found also for the
planting of forts.  Experts noted that no other
general selected more shrewdly the advantages of
site; no fort planted by Agricola was carried by
storm by the enemy, or abandoned by arrangement
and flight; as for a protracted siege, against this
they were secured by supplies for twelve months.
Accordingly, winter was shorn of its fears, and
sallies were frequent; each commander could
protect himself, whilst the enemy were helpless, and
therefore despaired.  They had been accustomed
in most places to weigh the 'incidents' of winter
against the summer's losses; now they were
repelled summer and winter alike."
</p>

<p>
So far, Tacitus.
</p>

<p>
But of all Agricola's notable achievements that
which specially concerns us now is his work in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
north.  Here, in 79 A.D., he constructed for military
purposes the famous cross-road, which in Saxon
times began to be called the "Stanegate," or
"Stone Way."  His chief centres, or advanced
bases, were Corbridge (Corstopitum) and Carlisle
(Luguvallium) between which this road ran.  His
other forts were on the same road line, but not
generally on the line of the Wall, as archæologists
formerly thought.  It may yet be proved that two
or three of the Wall forts were first built by him
as outliers of his chain of forts.
</p>

<p>
Later, in 81 A.D., he built a chain of forts from
the Forth to the Clyde, "the enemy being pushed
back into a separate island, so to speak," says
Tacitus; and thus he initiated the barrier of
Antoninus Pius.
</p>

<p>
After Agricola's victory over the Britons at
Mount Graupius, in 85 A.D., the Emperor Domitian,
jealous of his successful generalship, recalled him
to Rome.  Tacitus says that he "handed over a
peaceful and safe province to his successor."  His
seven years' rule had been so fruitful that one
cannot help wondering how much he would have
achieved if he had been allowed to continue his
work of tranquil colonization, and his conquest
over the affections of the people of Britain.  He
was only forty-five when recalled to Rome, and
nine years later he died, poisoned, as is thought,
by the still jealous Emperor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
</p>

<p>
Tacitus cannot pity him: "The true blessings
of life which lie in character he had fulfilled"; and
he closes his essay with these magnificent lines, so
often quoted and so eternally true, whether spoken
of the avowed Christian, or of the so-called pagan,
who has practised Christian virtues in a Christian
spirit, and in doing so has indeed been led by the
Light which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world:
</p>

<p>
"Vain alike and passing is the face of man and
the similitude thereof; only the fashion of the soul
remains, to be known and shown not through alien
substances and arts, but in your very life and walk.
Whatever we have loved in Agricola, whatever we
have admired, abides, and will abide, in the hearts
of men, in the procession of the ages, in the records
of history.  Many of the ancients has Forgetfulness
engulfed as though fame nor name were theirs:
Agricola, whose story here is told, will outlive death,
to be our children's heritage."
</p>

<p>
And as, looking southwards from the line of the
Wall, we trace the course of his road and note the
positions of his forts, we also can be grateful for his
upright life and his disinterested service.
</p>

<p>
Nerva succeeded Domitian, and was in his turn
succeeded by Trajan, who reigned till 117 A.D.  At
about this date the forts of Agricola, which had
held the country for thirty years, were entirely
swamped during a great native rising.  The Ninth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
Legion, then stationed at York, disappears from
history, having been annihilated by the Britons.
</p>

<p>
And next comes Hadrian, the actual inventor of
the Roman frontier system.  He became Emperor
in 117 A.D., and initiated his policy in Britain about
two years later.  It is now generally agreed that he
was responsible for the works of the Vallum, as well
as for the Stone Wall, with its forts, mile-castles
and turrets.
</p>

<p>
Here was an Emperor who lived no life of
self-indulgent ease, nor used his imperial rank merely
to serve his own private ends.
</p>

<p>
He was indefatigable in his journeyings through
his empire, to reorganize and reform.  Every
province came under his personal supervision, and
traces of his activity are to be met with everywhere.
He was also undoubtedly a great builder.  The
largest temple ever erected in Rome, the temple
of Venus and Roma, owes its origin to him, as also
do the Pantheon and the Castle of St. Angelo.  He
was therefore quite capable of conceiving and
carrying out such a project as the Great Wall.
</p>

<p>
He visited Britain in person, towards the close
of 121 A.D., or early in 122, but the works were only
completed after he had left, under the direction of
Aulus Platorius Nepos, his proprætor.
</p>

<p>
Antoninus Pius succeeded Hadrian in 138 A.D.
He was himself a man of peace, and left the settlement
of disturbances to his provincial governors.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
Under him Lollius Urbicus built the turf wall between
the Firths of Forth and Clyde, along the line of the
forts of Agricola.  This is known as the Antonine
Wall.  In mediæval times it was called Grahame's
Dyke.
</p>

<p>
Britain was very disturbed from 161 A.D. to
193 A.D. during the reigns of Marcus Aurelius, the
philosopher, and his son and successor, Commodus.
The Wall and its forts and turrets suffered much
during this period.
</p>

<p>
Under Septimius Severus there was still trouble,
and the Emperor came over in person, in 208 A.D.,
bringing with him his sons Antoninus and Geta.
The former is usually called Caracalla, from a Gallic
mantle which he had made fashionable in Rome.
Severus was an African by birth, and a soldier by
profession, having risen from the ranks, but he was
a splendid administrator.  On arriving in Britain,
he collected troops, repaired the roads, and rebuilt,
where necessary, the forts and the Wall.
</p>

<p>
Then we have a pathetic picture of the old Emperor,
hampered by gout, and obliged to be carried in a
litter or a closed chair, distracted by the quarrels
and ambition of his sons, and yet advancing far
into the enemy's country, under inconceivable
difficulties, and with a great loss of men.  Finally
he died at York, in 211 A.D., "worn out with
sorrow more than with disease."  It is said of him
that he had "a greater tenderness for his children
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
than for the republic;" and yet it was no secret
that his elder son had once endeavoured to stab
him in the back, and, failing, had tried to bribe his
physicians to poison him.  On their father's death
the sons returned to Rome, to succeed him, but in
less than a year the elder had contrived the murder
of the younger.
</p>

<p>
The inscribed stones which have been found
bring out very clearly that Severus left behind him
an impulse towards the restoration of the Wall and
its forts which continued until 240 A.D.
</p>

<p>
Britain was now left to herself.  Rome was too
much occupied with troubles at home to pay much
heed to her island province, and peaceful conditions
prevailed.
</p>

<p>
Taking advantage of Rome's preoccupation,
Carausius, who had charge of a Roman fleet, under
Diocletian, to repress the Saxon pirates, betrayed
his trust, and assumed the sovereignty of Britain
in 287 A.D.  For six years he ruled an independent
kingdom, to be betrayed, in his turn, and murdered
by his minister Allectus, who succeeded him.  Three
years later Rome resumed her authority, and
Allectus was slain.
</p>

<p>
Constantine is accused by the historian Zosimus
of having withdrawn the soldiers from the forts of
Britain to the towns, where they became effeminate.
Now Emperor succeeded Emperor in rapid succession.
Soon Rome had all she could do to keep
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
the Goths at bay; and, in 410 A.D., Honorius wrote
to the Britons to tell them they must look to
themselves for safety.
</p>

<p>
Experts differ as to when the Romans actually
abandoned the island, but it is safe to say that it
was early in the fifth century.
</p>

<p>
Rome's hold on Britain had thus lasted nearly
four centuries; and when we remember that it is
not much more than four centuries since Columbus
discovered America, we can better realize how
thoroughly Roman in that period the island and the
people must have become.
</p>

<p>
"Under the <i>Pax Romana</i>, established by Agricola,"
writes Mr. H. Rushton Fairclough in <i>Art
and Archæology</i>, Vol. I. No. 2, "Roman temples,
forums, dwelling-houses, baths and porticoes had
sprung up everywhere; and, above all, Roman
schools, where the youth of the land learnt with
pride to adopt the tongue and dress of the
conquerors."  And this was when more than three
centuries of Roman rule were yet to come!

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
DESCRIPTIVE
</h3>

<p>
What is this Wall like, of which we have
heard so much?
</p>

<p>
It consists of three parts:
</p>

<p>
1. A Stone Wall with a ditch on its northern
side.
</p>

<p>
2. A series of forts, mile-castles and Wall turrets,
connected by roads.
</p>

<p>
3. An earthwork known as "The Vallum," consisting
of a deep central ditch and two (frequently
three and sometimes four) earthern mounds, running
always to the south of the Wall and its fortifications.
</p>

<p>
Excavations and inscriptions have now pretty
well established the order and the period in which
the different parts were constructed, and it appears
to have been as follows:
</p>

<p>
1. Agricola built a series of forts (including
Corbridge and Carlisle) across the isthmus, about
79 A.D., with a road, afterwards known as the
Stanegate, connecting them.
</p>

<p>
2. Hadrian first built a new line of forts a short
distance to the north of the Stanegate line.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-019"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-019.jpg" alt="Fig. 1.--Section showing the relative positions of the Stone Wall, the Vallum and the Military Way.">
<br>
Fig. 1.&mdash;Section showing the relative positions of the Stone Wall, the Vallum and the Military Way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
</p>

<p>
3. Hadrian then constructed the Vallum, as a
limes or boundary, slightly to the south of these forts,
yet everywhere north of the older line of Agricola.
</p>

<p>
4. Hadrian finally built the Great Wall, linking
up the new forts and including a mile-castle every
seven furlongs, and two wall-turrets between every
pair of mile-castles.  He also made a road from castle
to castle, and so from fort to fort&mdash;122-127 A.D.
This great Stone Wall, was the last word in the
defensive problem.  The original scheme, of forts
and Vallum, had failed to ensure the safety of the
frontier; and the necessity for a continuous barrier
had become evident.
</p>

<p>
So it came about that the Wall was built.  In
the course of its building, the Vallum with its deep
ditch and high mounds would form a continuous
obstacle to the free passage of workers and building
materials coming from the south.  To obviate this
difficulty, the mounds of the Vallum were cut
through and the ditch was filled up at frequent
intervals, to form temporary level-crossings.
</p>

<p>
5. After the Great Wall was completed, the
Vallum-ditch was cleared where necessary, and the
clearings from the ditch were thrown up as an
additional mound on the south margin of the ditch.
This indicates that the Vallum still represented a
boundary: no longer, indeed, to the enemy, for
the Wall was now their boundary, but to the civil
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
population of the province of Britain.  North of
the Vallum was now a military district, "out of
bounds" for civilians.
</p>

<p>
6. Severus reconstructed great portions of the
Wall and forts, which had been thrown down by
the enemy&mdash;207-210 A.D.
</p>

<p>
It is thus clear that most of the work which
we see was originally designed by Hadrian in the
second century.
</p>

<p>
It would serve no purpose for me to go into
all the older arguments and theories as to who was
the builder of the Wall, and what was the object of
the Vallum, but I have endeavoured to give the
latest views, based on the most recent discoveries.
</p>

<p>
As is well known, archæologists do not now aim at
finding objects, but rather at learning history and
fixing dates.  Especially do they aim at dating
the various levels of occupation by means of the
pottery fragments found there&mdash;a method unheard-of
when excavations were first begun on the Wall.
Much still remains to be done in this direction.
</p>

<p>
The evidence in favour of Hadrian's having been
the builder of the Wall is now so strong as to be
irrefutable.  In four mile-castles have been found
slabs bearing his name and that of his proprætor,
Aulus Platorius Nepos.  The name of Severus has
not been found at all on the actual line of the Wall.
</p>

<p>
A bronze purse of coins was found hidden in
a quarry on Barcombe during the last century.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
There were no coins later than the time of Hadrian;
and, since the purse was probably hidden in his
reign by a worker in the quarry, this evidence
would point to Hadrian as a builder in stone, and
not merely the constructor of the Vallum, as some
have thought.
</p>

<p>
Many old writers have made reference both to
the stone Wall and the Vallum.
</p>

<p>
Camden, the antiquary, writing in 1587, says:
</p>

<p>
"Through the high part of Cumberland shooteth
that most famous Wall (in no case to be passed over
in silence) the limit of the Roman Province, the
Barbarian Rampier, the Forefence and Enclosure,
for so the ancients termed it, being called * * *
by Antonine, Cassiodore, and others, Vallum, that
is, the Rampier; by Bede, Murus, that is, the
Wall; by the Britons, Gual-Sever, Gal-Sever, Bal,
Val, and Mur-Sever; by the Scottish, Scottish-waith;
by the English, and those that dwell there-about,
the Picts Wall, or the Pehits Wall, the
Keepe Wall, and simply by way of excellencie, The
Wall."
</p>

<p>
Throughout this book we will call the stone
Wall "simply by way of excellencie," the Wall,
referring to the other parts of the fortifications, the
Vallum, forts, mile-castles and turrets, by their
several names.
</p>

<p>
And, before going farther, I may as well confess
the true state of my affections, for I am sure to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
found out sooner or later.  The Wall, "simply by
way of excellencie," is my real love; the Vallum
only takes a very secondary place.
</p>

<p>
I love the Wall for its aspiring nature, always
keeping to the very tops of the hills, when there
are any hills to be had, while the Vallum creeps
sluggishly along in the low land.
</p>

<p>
I love the Wall for the way in which it overcomes
obstacles, never swerving from its determination to
keep to the highest at all costs, while the Vallum
allows itself to be turned aside to the south by even
such a little obstacle as Down Hill.
</p>

<p>
And I love the Wall for the sense of strength
which it gives, even in its present battered
condition, a sense of strength and solidity which no
number of ditches and earth mounds could ever
give.  Earth mounds (of a sort) can be made by
earth-worms; for stone walls it takes men!
</p>

<p>
I love the Wall because I can picture it, manned
by the soldiers of the cohorts, as a living thing, all
eyes and ears; a link from sea to sea; a chain of
forts and turrets threaded on a single string!
</p>

<p>
And I love it because of its plain straightforward
purpose.  No one ever doubts what it was meant
to be or to do; whereas the object of the Vallum
is still to some extent a matter of conjecture, over
which wordy battles may be fought.
</p>

<p>
And I love the Wall because it lends itself to being
painted, while the Vallum stubbornly refuses to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
look anything but insignificant in a picture, however
imposing it may be when examined on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Lastly and chiefly, I love the Wall because of
the symbol it presents of a firm stand and a patient,
faithful, conscientious, tireless watch against the
enemy; no risks taken, no pains spared, no loopholes
left.  It is to me a symbol of vigilance and
endurance.
</p>

<p>
I know that I am self-condemned in the eyes of
the archæologist for having such a preference, for
is not the Vallum older than the Wall, and does not
that in itself constitute an unimpeachable claim to
superiority?
</p>

<p>
But I am not an archæologist; I am only an
artist with a taste for archæology, and that is why
I fall so far short of the true standard.
</p>

<p>
The Wall stretches all the way from Wallsend-on-Tyne,
4½ miles east of Newcastle, to Bowness-on-Solway,
a distance of 73½ miles; and the Vallum
runs alongside of it, on the south, from Newcastle
to Dykesfield, in Cumberland, a distance of about
66 miles.
</p>

<p>
The original height of the Wall was at least
12 feet to the rampart walk, so that it was probably
18 to 20 feet high, including the battlements.
</p>

<p>
Bede, writing from his monastery at Jarrow,
opposite Wallsend, somewhere about 700 A.D.,
says:
</p>

<p>
"It is eight feet in breadth, and twelve in height,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
in a straight line from east to west, as is still visible
to beholders."  He probably did not include the
battlements.
</p>

<p>
Sir Christopher Ridley, Vicar of Haltwhistle,
about 1572, writes:
</p>

<p>
"The breadth iij yardis, the hyght remaneth in
sum placis yet vij yardis."
</p>

<p>
Samson Erdeswick, visiting the Wall in 1574,
says:
</p>

<p>
"As touching Hadrian's Wall, begyning abowt
a town called Bonus standing vppon the river
Sulway now called Eden, and there yet standing
of the heyth of 16 fote, for almost a quarter of a
myle together, and so along the river syde estwards."
</p>

<p>
Camden, who was here in 1599, saw it 15 feet
high:
</p>

<p>
"Within two furlongs of Caervoran, on a pretty
high hill the Wall is still standing, fifteen feet in
height, and nine in breadth."
</p>

<p>
This must have been on the edge of the crags of
the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall.
</p>

<p>
The breadth of the Wall is about 9 feet 6 inches
at the foundation, and varies between 6 and 8 feet
at the top.  Dr. Bruce says: "Probably the
prevailing width is 8 feet."  The northern face is
continuous, but the southern face has many offsets
and insets, measuring from 4 to 12 inches, where
variations in the width of the Wall have occurred.
It is thought, therefore, that the work was done
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
in sections, simultaneously, and that each
superintending centurion was allowed to exercise his own
judgment as to the width.
</p>

<p>
This brings us to what are known as "centurial
stones," many of which are found along the line of
the Wall.  The inscription on these stones is always
preceded by a reversed C, thus [reversed C], or an angle, thus,
>, which indicates <i>Centuria</i>.  It seems probable
that they were set into the Wall to indicate that
a particular section was built by troops under
the command of such-and-such a centurion.  The
centurial sign is always followed by a name.
</p>

<p>
A deep V-shaped ditch defended the Wall all
the way on the north side, except where it was
protected by natural precipices.  This ditch, at
its greatest, was about 15 feet deep and 40 feet
across at the top.  It must have greatly added to
the formidable appearance of the Wall on the side
presented to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
No matter what the character of the material
to be excavated, the ditch clings closely to the
Wall on all the lower ground.  It is hewn through
basalt, sandstone and limestone with equal
indifference.
</p>

<p>
The Wall is constructed in the method usual
with the Romans; that is to say, it consists of a
rubble core mixed with mortar, faced on each side
by masonry blocks.  The stone used for the facing
is a species of sandstone.  The size of the blocks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
is very regular: 8 or 9 inches by 10 or 11 inches on
the face, and sometimes as much as 20 inches long.
The length is tapered off to form a wedge-shape,
so as to bind well into the core of the Wall.
After a little practice, one can readily recognize
the Wall stones where they have been made use of
in later buildings and in fences.
</p>

<p>
The front surface of the stones is often tooled
in a rough pattern, with diagonal lines, known as
"diamond broaching," or with waved lines, known
as "feather broaching."  The latter has been held
to be specially characteristic of Severus's work of
reconstruction.
</p>

<p>
The Wall was built on a foundation of flat
flagstones, laid on the rock.  Upon these, one or two
courses of facing-stones were set in place, and into
the intervening space was poured a mass of fluid
mortar.  Rough stones of any shape&mdash;chiefly
whinstones&mdash;were then introduced into the mortar,
which, when dry, bound all together in one solid
mass.  So course after course was added until the
required height was reached.
</p>

<p>
On gently undulating ground the courses of the
Wall keep parallel to the surface of the ground; on
steep slopes the courses are laid horizontally.
</p>

<p>
The colour of the stone is very varied; individual
stones are brownish, yellowish, reddish, grey; and
the general impression varies also because the stone
has not always "weathered" in the same way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
</p>

<p>
Like the Great Wall of China, the Wall disregards
obstacles, climbs hills, and crosses valleys and
streams, choosing always the greatest possible
heights to traverse.
</p>

<p>
Camden says of it:
</p>

<p>
"Verily, I have seene the tract of it, over the
high pitches and steepe descents of hills wonderfully
rising and falling."
</p>

<p>
It is set for the most part in very beautiful
surroundings, sometimes in the peaceful and fertile
lowlands, sometimes on the lonely barren hills,
with wide vistas stretching out to north and south.
The highest hill it climbs is Winshields, 1230 feet
high.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the Great Wall of China, it has suffered
much at the hands of the destroyer, and for miles
together scarcely a trace is to be seen.  In the
more or less populated districts it has been used
as a quarry, and farm-houses, churches, and pele-towers
have been built with its stones.  For 19 miles
out of Newcastle the road (made by General Wade
in 1753, from Newcastle to Carlisle) runs chiefly
on the foundations of the Wall, and much of the
Wall was pulled down then, to give place to "military
necessities."  This road I shall in future refer to
as "Wade's Road."

HERE FOR A LONG DISTANCE IT IS EASY TO WALK ALONG THE TOP <br>
OF THE WALL, WHICH IS 8 FEET WIDE, AND 5 OR 6 FEET HIGH.

<p>
The Wall is best preserved on the lonely heights,
as at Borcovicium, where in parts it may be seen
going up hill and down dale, at its original width
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
of 8 feet, and 5 or 6 feet high.  The greatest height
of any fragment still standing is 9 feet 10 inches,
at Hare Hill, Banks, in Cumberland.
</p>

<p>
The forts along the Wall, or "stations," as they
are sometimes called, are military cities, set at an
average distance of five miles apart, with barracks,
storehouses, baths, etc., and very often with suburbs
outside the enclosing wall.
</p>

<p>
The clue to the names of the forts has been found
in a document which has fitly been called the
"Who's Who" of the later Roman Empire.  This
document is known as the <i>Notitia</i>; and the section
which refers to the Wall is headed, <i>Item per lineam
Vatti</i>.  Then follows a list of all the forts along
the Wall, with the name of the body of troops
stationed at each.  There are twenty-three on the
list, and only the first twelve have been
satisfactorily identified&mdash;as follows:

</p>

<p>
The means of identification has been by altars
or other inscribed stones found on the spot.  For
instance, at Housesteads was found an altar with
this inscription:
</p>

<p>
"To Jupiter, the best and greatest, and the
deities of Augustus, the first cohort of the Tungrians
(a military one) commanded by Quintus Verius
Superstis, præfect."
</p>

<p>
At Carrawburgh there was found a stone of the date
237 A.D., with the words "COH · I · BATAVORUM"
very clearly inscribed.  At Chesterholm more than
one altar has been found inscribed "COH · IIII · GALLORVM."
</p>

<p>
At Walwick Chesters was found an important
slab declaring that "the [soldiers] of the second
<i>ala</i> (or cavalry regiment) of Asturians restored [this
temple which had fallen down] through age."
</p>

<p>
At Great Chesters a roofing slab was found
stamped "COH · I · ASTVR," besides other inscriptions.
</p>

<p>
So also at Carvoran and Birdoswald there is
abundant confirmation of the <i>Notitia</i> statement.
</p>

<p>
The largest fort is Amboglanna, 5½ acres; the
smallest is at Drumburgh, ¾ of an acre, an
exceptionally small site.

Fig. 2: COMPARATIVE PLANS OF MILE-CASTLE & TURRET
</p>

<hr>

<p>
The mile-castles or <i>castella</i> were placed at the
distance of one Roman mile, or seven furlongs, from
each other.  They vary in size, but are roughly
about 60 feet by 50.  The Wall forms their north
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
wall; their east and west walls are bonded into
the Wall, so they were evidently built at the same
time as the Wall.  Their southern angles have been
rounded off outside, though rectangular within.
</p>

<p>
There has always been a massive gateway to the
north and to the south, with a central road between,
and inner buildings on either side of it.
</p>

<p>
There were two Wall turrets between each pair of
mile-castles.  They were sentry-boxes, recessed into
the great Wall, with walls 3 feet thick, and measuring
about 12 feet by 10.
</p>

<p>
The Romans always had a military way accompanying
their fortifications.  The Stanegate, made
by Agricola, has a foundation of cobbles bedded
in clay, and on that is a layer of cobbles or gravel,
considerably raised in the middle.  Kerbstones on
either side mark its limits.  It is now certain,
through work done, that the paved military road
which accompanies the Wall extended for its whole
distance, running along between the Wall and the
Vallum.  It is about 18 feet wide, and can be
very frequently recognized by its curved surface
and stone kerbs, although it is grass-grown.  The
modern field-gates are very often placed upon it.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
THE VALLUM
</h3>

<p>
The history of the Vallum in detail would
appear to be as follows:
</p>

<p>
The Emperor Hadrian decided that his
new frontier should be defended by a chain of new
forts, and that a great ditch&mdash;the Vallum-ditch&mdash;should
be dug across the island, along the line of
these forts, to mark the boundary of the Roman
Province of Britain.  This would be quite consistent
with his usual policy of limiting the extent of the
Roman Provinces in order to strengthen his hold
on what it was most important to retain.  By
keeping to the south of the chain of forts, the ditch
would come under their protection.
</p>

<p>
That the ditch, and not the mounds, was the
objective is pretty certain, for the ditch was made
continuous at all costs, while the mounds were
afterwards subject to trespass by the road, by
quarries, by a mile-castle etc.
</p>

<p>
The mounds are the upcast from the ditch, not
thrown up on the very edge of the ditch, for then
rain and other causes would soon have combined
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
to fill the ditch again, but carried some 24 feet
away, leaving a flat safety platform, known as a
"berm," on each side, between the ditch and the
mound.  Thus the mounds had the effect of making
the ditch appear deeper, and yet had no great
tendency to fall back again into it.  The mounds
are not the mere upcast from the ditch; sods, and
sometimes stones are laid as kerbs to strengthen
them, and keep them from settling down on themselves.
</p>

<p>
A subsidiary mound to the south of the ditch is
often found, covering a portion of the berm.  This
is now known to be no part of the original scheme,
but to consist of a later clearing of the ditch.
Sometimes there are two subsidiary mounds, one to the
north as well.
</p>

<p>
In this connection, three important points have
been noted by Mr. F. G. Simpson and Dr. R. C. Shaw.
</p>

<p>
1. That there are ancient causeways across the
Vallum-ditch in some parts of its course, where the
ditch has been quite filled up level with the berms.
</p>

<p>
2. That wherever these causeways occur, gaps
occur, opposite the causeways, in the Vallum-mounds;
and this suggests that a passage-way has
been cut through the mounds, and that the earth
removed has been used for filling up the ditch at
the same point, so as to make a roadway right
across the earth-work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-035"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-035.jpg" alt="Fig. 3.--Three stages in the history of the Vallum.">
<br>
Fig. 3.&mdash;Three stages in the history of the Vallum.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
</p>

<p>
3. That in many cases gaps occur in the mounds
where there are no corresponding causeways across
the ditch; but it is just in these regions that the
subsidiary mound is found.  Where there are
causeways, there is no subsidiary mound.
</p>

<p>
The deduction is that when the causeways had
served their purpose the ditch was cleared again,
and the clearings were cast up to form the marginal
mound; but nothing was done to fill up the gaps,
because the ditch was the only consideration.
</p>

<p>
Excavations have all tended to support this
theory.  The causeways were evidently made not
long after the digging of the ditch, because the
ditch is not silted up under the cast-up rubbish of
which the causeways are formed; and everywhere
else in the Vallum-ditch there is a depth of 3 or 4
feet of silt.
</p>

<p>
Gaps occur in the Vallum-mounds all along the
line to beyond Carlisle, with great regularity (as if
they had some set purpose) and generally about
45 yards apart.  The explanation suggested is that
nearly all the stone and building-materials needed
for building the Wall and repairing the forts had
to be brought from beyond the Vallum; that
thousands of men, employed in bringing materials,
would be constantly passing over the mounds and
ditch of the Vallum.  Hence the need for
causeways and gaps.
</p>

<p>
We can imagine the men would get impatient
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
at having to climb a mound, descend into a ditch,
and then climb another mound at each journey
north or south.  And if rough carts were used, a
causeway would be a necessity.  By degrees continuous
traffic would of itself sink a path across the
mounds; and what would be easier than to make
deliberate gaps and fill up the ditch with the soil?
</p>

<p>
The Romans were a methodical people, and in
undertaking an enormous work like the Wall they
would certainly have points, at regular distances
apart, to which building materials had to be brought.
The only difficulty in the theory seems to be that
a gap every 45 yards could hardly be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Supposing this theory to be correct, then the
Vallum <i>is older</i> than the Wall and its contemporary
buildings, but very little older.  It has already been
proved that the Vallum is not older than the original
forts, because it always curves round to the south
when it approaches a fort, in order to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
The Stone Wall appears to have been an after-thought,
found necessary for the final solution of
the defensive problem.
</p>

<p>
It has long been a question whether there was
not originally a turf-wall right across the island,
thrown up hastily to mark out the course of the
Stone Wall, and as a temporary defence, and then
gradually replaced by the Stone Wall.  The presence
of a piece of turf-wall, more than a mile long, between
Birdoswald and Wallbowers, running north of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
Vallum and south of the Stone Wall, has to be
accounted for; and for two reasons it seems probable
that this was only a temporary structure: first,
because there is no carefully-laid stone foundation
under the turves, as is the case with the Antonine
Wall; secondly, because no military way accompanies
it, and the Romans always had a road
accompanying their fortifications.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simpson thinks this particular stretch
represents a mistake in the laying out of the works,
because it is so close to the Vallum that a mile-castle
could not have been built at the usual position:
which mistake was corrected by the Stone Wall,
but the fruits of which it was not thought necessary
to remove.
</p>

<p>
Or&mdash;another theory&mdash;this turf-wall may have
been a temporary local barrier, thrown up during
some interruption of the building of the Stone Wall.
It is certain that the turf-wall is the earlier, for where
it ends, at Wallbowers, its ditch goes under the
Stone Wall, and had to be filled up when the Stone
Wall was built.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE WALK: WALLSEND TO WALBOTTLE
</h3>

<p>
I decided to begin my walk at the Newcastle
end because I thought it would be the least
interesting part, and I wanted to get it over.
However, it proved far more interesting than I
expected.
</p>

<p>
I reached Newcastle from King's Cross at five
o'clock on a May morning, and, booking my
luggage, I started off at once, knapsack on back,
for Wallsend.
</p>

<p>
The sun had risen, and though the houses hid
it, rosy clouds that faced me proclaimed its presence
as I turned eastwards.
</p>

<p>
Along Collingwood Street I went, across Pilgrim
Street, then under the railway-arch which crosses
City Road; and there, on my right, were the ruins
of the old Sallyport gateway, which stand near&mdash;if
not on&mdash;the line of the wall.
</p>

<p>
Then past "St. Dominic's Priory," with its modern
buildings and prosaic brass-plate, to Byker Bridge,
over the valley of the Ouseburn, which appears to
be all valley and very little burn.  At first I searched
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
in vain for any sign of water; I saw only a valley
full of rubbish.  And the stony bed of the little
stream contained even more broken crockery than
stones.
</p>

<p>
Byker Hill followed, lined with small shops.  I
sighed as I remembered what it had looked like in
the eighteenth century.  For before "industrial
necessities" claimed it (as shown in Dr. Bruce's
third edition) it was a country road with a
picturesque windmill on the hill, a large piece of
Wall still standing, and a beautiful view of the city
and the Tower of St. Nicholas' Church (now the
Cathedral) in the distance!
</p>

<p>
Turning to the left along Shields Road, I was
amused to see an old woman, in dirty apron and
grey shawl, going round knocking at much
be-curtained windows on the ground floor with a small
hammer: "Lizzie, it's well-nigh six o'clock";
"Mary, it's time ye riz;" and so on, at house
after house.  It was my first sight of a "knocker-up."
</p>

<p>
The misty valley of the Tyne began to show on
my right, with clusters of chimneys peering through
the mist.  I thought Shields Road would never
end; but it brought me to Wallsend at last.  There
I turned to the right, and lighted at once on Hadrian
Street!  And, spying an "inscribed stone" on a
building opposite, I crossed over, and this is what
I read:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "The Eastern Gateway of<br>
  the Roman Camp of<br>
  SEGEDUNUM<br>
  stood about twenty yards<br>
  to the south of this spot<br>
  and remains of it were found<br>
  when this house was built<br>
  Anno Domini 1912."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The building is Simpson's Hotel, Wallsend.  And
so I really had reached the Wall's End (although
for me it was the Wall's Beginning) in the midst
of a wilderness of houses.
</p>

<p>
There are drawings in Newcastle which show the
south-east angle of Segedunum in 1848, with grassy
banks, and trees, and a peaceful river, and not a
house to be seen.
</p>

<p>
I wandered down towards the Tyne now, to get
an idea of where that south-east angle must have
been, but it seemed hopeless, with buildings crowded
thickly together as they are.  There should be a
stone to mark the site, but I did not find it.  The
Wall ran down from this corner right into the
river, just as it did at the other end, into the Solway,
at Bowness, to cut off the passage of an enemy.
</p>

<p>
While part of Messrs. Swan &amp; Hunter's shipyard
was being levelled, prior to the building of the
<i>Mauretania</i>, this part of the Wall was discovered,
not far from the river-bank.  The <i>Carpathia</i> was
"completing" at the time at the same yard, and
several Wall-stones were placed in the saloon in
a glass case.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
</p>

<p>
I turned westward along Hadrian Street, past
the row of houses called "The Roman Wall,"
and made for the farm-house of Old Walker.  The
Wall-ditch can be seen at intervals, and fragments
of the core; and I could recognize Wall-stones in
the farm-house.  I saw no signs of mile-castles,
though there should be two before we reach Byker
Hill, nor did I trace any further signs of Wall,
though I followed its course as I had come&mdash;by the
Priory, Sallyport Gate, Wall Knoll, Pilgrim Street,
and St. Nicholas' Church (the Cathedral), of which
Leland says, writing about 1539: "S. Nicolas
Chirch in Newcastel stondith on the Picth Waulle."
</p>

<p>
Newcastle was the second fort on the line, the
fort of PONS AELII, so-called from the bridge
which Hadrian, who was of the Ælian family, built
across the Tyne.  The present Swing Bridge marks
the site of Hadrian's Bridge, which appears to have
lasted, with various repairs, till 1248 A.D.  Traces
of the old Roman piers have been found.  The
exact site of the fort of Pons Aelii has not been
ascertained.
</p>

<p>
From the railway station at Newcastle, the line
of the Wall is up Westgate Hill, on the very road
itself; and the Vallum ran parallel to it, along the
south side of the road, as is shown in a drawing by
H. B. Richardson, made in 1848, before the houses
were built there.  No traces of either are now to
be seen.
</p>

<p>

<br>
FIG. 4.&mdash;Roman Head, found on Benwell Hill.
</p>

<p>
In a nurseryman's garden on the right, as I neared
Benwell Hill, I noticed a very beautiful head,
evidently of Roman workmanship.  It was only
a mask, with a little drapery hanging from it, and
might have served as the keystone of an arch.
The laughing eyes looked downwards, the mouth
slightly open with a gentle smile, the hair parted
in the middle, and brought in waves rather low over
the forehead.  There was very delicate modelling
about the mouth.  I went up to the house, and
asked to be allowed to make a drawing of this
head.  The nurseryman's wife told me that her
husband's grandfather had dug it up in his ground
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
as well as other Roman treasures.  She showed me
a tiny Roman altar, no more than a small stone
bowl with a foot, in which she said many a Christian
baby had been baptized.  They used to send over
and borrow it for baptisms at the mission opposite.
It had been dark in colour once, like the head, but
she had scrubbed it till it was quite light.
</p>

<p>
The fonts of the churches at Haydon Bridge and
at Chollerton have both been Roman altars.
</p>

<p>
So here we have pagan altars adapted to Christian
uses, just as we have pagan festivals in the Church's
calendar; and pagan marriage and funeral customs,
borrowed from Rome, and used in the Christian
Church even to the present day.
</p>

<p>
After sketching the smiling lady, and finding her
fascination grow in the process, I continued my
way up the hill, until I saw on the right a large
reservoir, and on the left three private houses,
known as Condercum, Condercum House, and
Pendower.  Here the road cuts right across the
site of the Roman fort of CONDERCUM, the third
on the line.
</p>

<p>
The gardener at Pendower was busy just inside
the gate, so I inquired about the Roman remains,
and he readily consented to show me what was to
be seen.  He led me past mighty rhododendrons,
in full bloom, to the southern side of the garden,
where what was evidently a fine piece of the southern
wall of the fort was still standing, some 30 feet long.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
overgrown with London pride and bluebells, and
shadowed by beautiful trees.  Part of a lintel lay
amongst the stones.
</p>

<p>
Hearing that I was "walking the Wall," the
gardener recommended to me the Temperance
Hotel at Matfen, kept by some friends of his, and
I made a note of it for future use, and now pass
on the recommendation to my readers.  Accommodation
along the Wall is not too easy to get.
Matfen is a very pretty village, 2 miles north of
the Wall, at a point 14 miles west of Newcastle.
</p>

<p>
The gardener pointed out to me, over the dividing
fence, the foundations of the little temple in the
grounds of Condercum House, to which I next
made my way.  Here another friendly gardener
came to my aid, and I saw the temple at close
quarters, with its stone pavement, circular apse,
and solemn grouping of yew-trees round the apsidal
end.  These yews were evidently planted soon after
the temple was excavated, some forty years ago.
There was a rough stone head of the Sun-god, and
there were mill-stones "for the women to grind the
sacred corn during the temple-services"&mdash;so said my
guide.  Two altars, which stood in their places at
the ends of the apse when the building was
uncovered, are now in the Blackgate Museum,
Newcastle.
</p>

<p>
The eastern wall of the fort runs through these
grounds.  I was told that some of the Roman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
masonry had been knocked down by soldiers who
occupied the house during the recent war, and
that it had been very unsatisfactorily replaced by
masons.
</p>

<p>
The family was away, so the gardener let me
roam about by myself; and in a sunny meadow
sloping down towards the Tyne, I found distinct
traces of the suburban buildings of the fort.  The
Vallum is here recognizable for the first time, towards
the south.
</p>

<p>
And now to return to the road.  Hutton says of
the Wall in this part: "Its bare stones under my
feet are frequently distinguishable from those used
for mending the road."  But the tarred surface for
motor-cars has quite obliterated every sign of the
old stones now.
</p>

<p>
It was getting very hot when I left Condercum,
and this same tarred surface made walking rather
trying, for in many places it had become soft and
sticky with the heat, and not even the path on
either side had been left free.  At some points the
very gutters ran with tar.  There was no shade
from trees overhead, except at long intervals; it was
"the hottest day of the year," as the papers said
next day, though as yet it wanted an hour or so of
noon.  But I trudged on, inspired by my quest,
and well knowing that my first day was bound to
be my worst day, compelled, as I was, to keep to
the hard high road.  For 19 miles out of Newcastle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
the road runs mainly upon the foundations of the
Wall.
</p>

<p>
A steep hill, Benwell Hill, leads down from
Condercum to East Denton.  It was on this hill
that John Wesley, with his step-daughter and
grand-children, had a narrow escape from injury or death.
The horses took fright, and ran away, dashing
through a closed gate as if it had been a cobweb,
and then across a corn-field.  The little girls were
terrified, but Wesley writes: "I told them, 'Nothing
will hurt you; do not be afraid'; feeling no more
fear or care than if I had been sitting in my
study."  The horses stopped suddenly, just on the brink of
a precipice.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the hill, the road crosses Denton
Burn, once a pretty stream, but now dry; I saw
only a dirty green puddle in which a dirty brown
sparrow was trying to bathe.  Just before the
burn, on the left, a stile leads to the very first piece
of Wall which appears above ground.  It is only a
few paces south of the road, and has been enclosed
by a wooden fence, but a mere fraction of the fence
was left; the rest had apparently been stolen for
firewood.  This piece of Wall is 9½ feet wide.  When
Hutton saw it, it was 36 feet long, and had an
apple-tree growing on it.  There is much less left
now, and even the dead trunk of the apple-tree
has gone.
</p>

<p>
Mounting the opposite hill, I soon came to Denton
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
Hall, a ghost-haunted old house on the right, built
of Wall-stones in 1503 by the monks of Tynemouth,
as a summer residence.  A few sculptured stones
from the Wall are to be seen in the hall.
Mrs. Elizabeth Montague, "The Queen of the Blue
Stocking," lived there from 1760, and entertained
many distinguished guests.
</p>

<p>
Now I felt that I had at last got beyond Newcastle.
The fields were golden with buttercups;
the may-trees were masses of pearly white; beneath
them the cattle stood drowsily in the heat; and
away in the distance the hills south of the Tyne
lost themselves in a blue haze.
</p>

<p>
Opposite Denton Hall, the core of the Wall can
be seen, and the Vallum, running along the bottom
of the meadow.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
WALBOTTLE TO EAST WALLHOUSES
</h3>

<p>
The first indication of a mile-castle I noted
in a field on the left, just before reaching
the lodge of West Denton House.  It was
just a daisy-covered mound, as I saw it, with cows
lying about on it.
</p>

<p>
I pushed on up the hill towards Walbottle (A.S.
<i>botel</i>, an abode; the abode on the Wall), with the
Wall-ditch running alongside.  At the top there is
a beautiful view across the valley of the Tyne.
The painter Martin, a native of Haydon Bridge, is
said to have made it the basis of his picture, "The
Plains of Heaven."
</p>

<p>
Walbottle is now an unattractive colliery village,
whatever it may have been in Saxon times.  There
were many colliers about, for the strike was on,
and I saw women and children searching in the
rubbish at the pit-heads for scraps of coal.
</p>

<p>
At the Engine Inn at Walbottle I was able to get
a bottle of lemonade, and was also plentifully supplied
with soap and water in the back-kitchen by the kindly
landlady.  So I went on my way much refreshed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
</p>

<p>
Soon I came to Walbottle Dene House, a farm-house
on the right, in the front garden of which
are the splendid remains of the northern gateway
of a mile-castle, the first mile-castle to be seen
uncovered.  The course of the road was altered
here to avoid injury to this mile-castle after it had
been excavated.  The huge stones can be easily
seen by looking over the low garden wall.
</p>

<p>
Wall-stones appear in the hedge on the right a
little farther on; and then comes Walbottle Dene,
a steep little ravine, with paths traversing its
tree-covered sides, green with ferns and fresh spring
foliage, and the Newburn flowing through at the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
In the mining village of Throckley, I saw crowds
collected for a funeral.  The miners on strike were
sitting in rows on the path opposite the house,
dressed in their Sunday clothes, to do honour to
their neighbour.  A late-comer overtook me, and
said as he passed: "A hot day."  I said: "Yes;
I am glad it is fine for your holiday."  From that
we came to the question of the strike (as I had
intended), and the respective claims of the owners
and the miners.  He told me he had been in every
trade you can name, and coal-mining was the
worst.  I said: "Then why are you in it now?"
and he replied: "Because of the pay."  He then
described to me the unhealthiness and the dangers
of a miner's life, and to emphasize it he said: "You
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
should compare what these men are now with what
they looked like six weeks ago; why, they are not
the same men!"  He drew such a vivid picture of
the hardships, that I said, in all good faith: "Oh, if
only a substitute could be found for coal!"  But
there I found he did not agree with me at all, any
more than the owners would have done.
</p>

<p>
It is a truism that there must be something
wrong with a society in which the workers in a
disagreeable and dangerous calling would not have
it made less dangerous because the very danger
gives them a claim to higher wages.  They are used
to the danger, and they are used to the wages;
they would rather keep both!  And who can blame
them, things being as they are?  Perhaps some
day we may reach a condition of society in which
every labour-saving device, or danger-averting
discovery, will bless the whole of the community,
and penalize none.  This must surely come about
in proportion as we learn to think of mankind as
"one body," and to see that if one member
suffers, every member is bound to suffer with it.
</p>

<p>
There can be no real gain through another's loss.
</p>

<p>
My miner-friend took my remarks very good-temperedly,
and joined the groups seated on the
ground as soon as we came up to them.
</p>

<p>
Opposite the Filter-beds at Throckley, I turned
off on the left, through an inviting-looking green
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
meadow, and, crossing the Vallum, sat down under
some trees to rest.  A man and a boy were busy
chopping and carting logs of wood in the little
plantation near me&mdash;another sign of the coal-strike.
Soon after returning to the road I saw traces of
another mile-castle.
</p>

<p>
All this time the Wall-ditch can be traced on the
right for the greater part of the way, and the
Vallum on the left, at varying distances from the
road, about 30 to 50 yards.  At the top of the hill
leading down to Heddon-on-the-Wall, both the
Wall-ditch and the Vallum are a delight to the eye
which has perhaps hitherto been tempted to see
them as monotonous.  Both ditches are cut through
the sandstone rock.  This was a specially good place
for testing the shape of the Vallum-ditch, and
sections made in 1893 proved it to be flat-bottomed
and not V-shaped, just as it was later found to be
along its whole length.
</p>

<p>
A little way down the hill, by climbing into the
field on the left, we can see the Wall, 5 or 6 courses
high, and, built into it, an interesting circular
chamber of unknown use, 7 feet in diameter.  The
Vallum-ditch is here only 35 yards to the south.
</p>

<p>
As I entered Heddon, my thoughts began to
turn towards refreshment, but the only available
place for a meal looked so uninviting that I passed
on.  It was early-closing day in all the villages I
had come through, so no shops had been open
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
after one o'clock, and I had let that hour slip by
without knowing what a crucial hour it was.
</p>

<p>
At Heddon a road turns off on the left, leading
to Horsley and Corbridge.
</p>

<p>
John Wesley was preaching near Horsley in 1755.
It was a noted centre of Nonconformity, because
it fulfilled the necessary condition for meeting-places
(required then by law) of being "more than
5 miles from a parish church."
</p>

<p>
Wesley writes in his diary:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wednesday</i>, 21 May 1755.&mdash;I preached at
Nafferton, near Horsley, about 13 miles from
Newcastle.  We rode chiefly on the new western
road, which lies on the old Roman Wall.  Some
part of this is still to be seen, as are the remains of
most of the towers, which were built a mile distant
from each other, quite from sea to sea.  But where
are the men of renown who built them, and who
once made all the land tremble?  Crumbled into
dust!  Gone hence, to be no more seen, till the
earth shall give up her dead!"
</p>

<p>
The next fort on the line of the Wall is VINDOBALA,
and the farm-house of Rudchester stands
close to its site.
</p>

<p>
When I was only a mile from this place a large
motor-lorry passed me, going at full speed.  To
my surprise, it stopped suddenly in front of me,
and when I came up to it, the driver kindly offered
me a lift.  I was indeed sorry to decline.  The hill
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
was steep in front of me, and I had already walked
about 16 miles, not counting digressions; but in
any case I could only have travelled as far as
Rudchester, for I did not want to miss seeing Vindobala.
And then, I <i>did</i> want to walk every foot of the
way, from sea to sea!  So I resisted the tempter,
though thanking him sincerely, and he was soon
out of sight.
</p>

<p>
The road was very much pleasanter here, shaded
by trees or by high green hedges, and with grassy
strips to walk upon.
</p>

<p>
At Rudchester the house and farm-buildings lie
a little way off the road, on the left, and are all
well to the south of the site of the fort.  A lane
crosses the road at right-angles, and the entrance
to the farm is a little way down this lane.  Buoyed
up with hopes of tea, I made my way there first;
not to the "big house," but to a smaller one, where
I found the farm-bailiff (as I suppose) and his sister
had just finished their tea.  They most kindly
asked me in, and the sister said the kettle was
boiling, and she could soon "make some fresh."  They
had only just moved in, and had no idea that
there was any special archæological interest attached
to the place.  When I inquired about the Roman
"Station," the sister said: "Would it be Wylam
Station ye're wanting?" referring to the nearest
railway station, 2 miles to the south.  When I
had had tea (and how welcome it was!) she took
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
me to the "big house."  The master was away,
but the housekeeper showed me the drawing-room
fireplace, where a centurial stone from the Wall
forms what was once the actual hearth on which
the fire was kindled.  It plainly shows the marks
of fire.  Now a modern grate has been fitted in
above it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Like most of the houses
along this line, on the
south it has a sunny
garden sloping towards
the Tyne valley, with a
glorious widespread view,
such as one would not
expect on seeing the house
from the road.
</p>

<p>
They took me through
the garden, and then
through a plantation, to
see the "Giant's Grave,"
a trough cut out of the
solid rock, 12 feet long,
4½ feet wide, and 2 feet deep; and the housekeeper
held stoutly to the opinion that its original purpose
had been the brewing of beer.  "Giant's Grave,
indeed!" said she; "better call it the Giant's
Bath!"
</p>

<p>
Before leaving, I traced the general outlines of
the fort.  With its southern gateway and ramparts,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
it can be easily made out, between the farm-buildings
and the road, the road itself probably representing
its <i>via principalis</i>.  The house, farm-buildings and
field-fences are mostly built of stones from the
Wall and fort.  A mediæval pele-tower was the
nucleus of the present house.
</p>

<p>
I took my leave of Rudchester much refreshed,
and grateful that my experience had been the exact
opposite of old Hutton's, for this is the verse with
which he commemorates his visit:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I saw old Sir at dinner sit,<br>
  Who ne'er said, 'Stranger, take a bit,'<br>
  Yet might, although a Poet said it,<br>
  Have sav'd his beef, and rais'd his credit."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The site of another mile-castle is recognizable by
the gate into a field a little farther on; and then
comes "The Iron Sign," once an inn, with Roman-inscribed
stones built into the front.  The old lady
who lived here had recently been killed by a passing
motor-car, while crossing the road, so I was told.
</p>

<p>
Harlow Hill then came into sight, and glad I was
to see it, for I hoped to spend the night there.  It
was Hutton's first stage from Newcastle.  I had
written to the Temperance Hotel there (mentioned
by Dr. Bruce), asking if I could have a bed, and
enclosing a post-card for reply; and although I had
received no answer, at least I had not had an
unfavourable one.
</p>

<p>
The Wall-ditch showed very clearly ahead, running
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
up to Harlow Hill, on the right of the road; and
the Vallum, diverging from the road, could be seen
on the left.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the village, I inquired at once for the
Temperance Hotel, only to be told I was several
years too late!  It had been closed during the war.
A day or two later I received my post-card, which
had been pursuing me.  It bore no signature, and
only this sad legend: "No temperance at Harlow
Hill."
</p>

<p>
The hotel, where Hutton had spent one night,
was still there, a substantial stone building, but it
was now occupied by a private family.  I made
inquiries from end to end of the village street, but
no one could give me a bed, so I found I must walk
on a mile or so farther to the next Inn, the "Robin
Hood."
</p>

<p>
Passing the Whittledene Reservoirs, I noticed
the houses of Welton (Wall-town), and turned aside
to the south for half a mile, to try my chance there.
</p>

<p>
The road runs along the very brink of the
reservoir.  Several anglers were seated on the steep
banks, very much preoccupied, and their cars were
waiting for them in the road.
</p>

<p>
Welton Hall is pleasantly situated, overlooking
the water.  It is built entirely of Wall-stones, and
the oldest part is a pele-tower.  The initials and
date&mdash;"W.W.&mdash;1614"&mdash;over the lintel of the
back-door, commemorate the building of the more recent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
portion by Will of Welton, a sort of modern Samson.
Sitting outside the tower one day, when old and
blind, he called a ploughboy to him, and wanted to
feel his arm, to test its strength.  The boy, afraid
of being hurt, held out the iron plough-coulter
instead of his arm, and Will promptly snapped it
in two, remarking, "Men's banes are naught but
girsels (gristles) to what they were in my day."
</p>

<p>
A servant-girl was sitting sewing outside the
back-door as I drew near.  In answer to my inquiry,
she said there was no village, only a farm, but I
might perhaps get a bed there.  Outside the
farm-gate was a little group of boys, playing quoits
with large rusty iron rings.  Inside the yard I
found a busy scene.  Several women were occupied
in painting, beating or cleaning furniture of various
kinds, which was all spread out in the farm-yard.
One of them was painting a kitchen bench and
table Indian red.  Very tentatively I made my
request.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ye see that we are busy spring-cleaning?"
was the reply, but in no unkindly tone.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, I did see, only too well; and I also saw,
with my mind's eye, another mile and a half of
road stretching out before me, and the night coming
down, so I beat a retreat as quickly as I could.
How tiresome I must have seemed to those busy
women!
</p>

<p>
I passed a pleasant-looking house before reaching
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
the Robin Hood Inn, and, seeing the front door
wide open, I walked up the garden, gay with pansies
and polyanthus, and knocked.  No reply.  I went
round to the back-door, which was also wide open.
Still no reply.  So I came away.  Then I tried a
farm-house.  The woman who answered my knock
told me she was housekeeper to two old bachelors,
one of whom was ill, so she could not help me.
Lastly I came to the Robin Hood Inn.  An
uncompromising notice hung in the front window:
"CLOSED;" and a motor-car stood outside the door.
However, I knocked, and a girl of about fourteen,
very neatly dressed, answered my knock.  She
told me that their family was so large that they
never had a bed to spare; that her sister was ill
(it was the doctor's car outside), and they could
not possibly take me in.  I asked for lemonade
or aerated water.  No; they had nothing at all.
"Well, a glass of plain water?"  Yes, I could
have that, and welcome.  When she returned with
it, I inquired how far it was to the next inn.  She
could only tell me of Matfen, nearly 3 miles away.
I had already walked more than 20 miles, not
counting the distance covered in my explorations
so in desperation I mentioned the house with the
open doors, and said: "Do you think the lady of
that house would give me a bed?"  She brightened
up, and answered: "Why, perhaps she would;
she's very nice.  I'll ask her; she is upstairs helping
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
with my sister."  So she came down, and she <i>was</i>
very nice.  She was, indeed, a good Samaritan, for
I hardly felt I could walk much farther.  She gave
me the kindest welcome, and her husband did the
same when he came home and found me enjoying
a good supper with his wife.  Never did a
guest-chamber seem more attractive than hers to me that
night.  Remember, I had spent the previous night
in the train, travelling from London; I had started
on my walk at five o'clock that morning, and the
walk for a great part of the day had been on an
unsheltered high road, and in a temperature of 81°
in the shade.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
HUNNUM AND ST. OSWALD'S
</h3>

<p>
Next morning I took leave of my kind
hostess, and set out again, prepared to
take things easily that day.
</p>

<p>
The Wall-ditch was very deep and clearly marked
on my right, planted with trees (chiefly young
larch), and carpeted with flowers&mdash;primroses, herb
bennet, and the purple giant cranesbill.  The Vallum
also was conspicuous on the other side of the road.
</p>

<p>
In the garden of the next house, "Wall Houses,"
apple-blossom, purple and white lilac, and laburnum
were all in full beauty, though they had been quite
over in the south before I left.  It was a sweet
fresh morning, and a gentle breeze was sending
down showers of apple-blossom over an old lady
walking in the garden.
</p>

<p>
The next house is called "High Wall Houses,"
and is all that is left of a village of that name.
Everywhere it is Wall&mdash;Wall&mdash;Wall in the
place-names&mdash;all along the line.
</p>

<p>
A road on the left leads down to Corbridge, and
then for the first time the road begins to be quite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
overarched by trees, very beautiful and shady, and
it continues so for some distance.  Almost opposite
the road to Matfen are traces of a mile-castle.  A
little way farther on is Matfen Piers, a small
farm-house, with a long piece of the Wall-ditch
surrounded by a strong stone wall in front of the
house, and planted as an orchard with apple-trees
and currant-bushes.  It looked as if a stream ran
along the bottom in wet weather.  Now the apples
were in blossom, and there were young lambs
frisking amongst the currant-bushes.  I went round
to the back of the house to ask for a drink of water,
but the place seemed deserted.  Wild rabbits were
playing on the back doorstep.  And yet the scraper
had been used quite recently.  I was puzzled at
first to think what it was that gave the house a
sort of sophisticated air in front; and then I saw.
Several of the inverted cups used on telegraph-posts
were stuck up in the pear-tree which grows
on the house, and it quite gave the impression of
telephonic connection!  But they were only traps
set for unwary earwigs.
</p>

<p>
The newly discovered causeways across the ditch
of the Vallum called for attention next.  They are
readily discernible in this region.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this, gorse began to appear on the
mounds of the Vallum.  The overhanging trees
had ceased, and distant hills to the south of the
Tyne had come into view, while the Wall-ditch was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
again planted with young larch, and this time
bright with marsh marigolds.  The road runs
through the village of Halton Shields, which now
consists only of a chapel, a school, a farm-house
and two cottages, though in Hutton's time there
were twelve houses.
</p>

<p>
On Carr Hill the mounds and ditch of the Vallum
are more striking than ever.  A little farther on,
a tree-covered mound, known as Down Hill, intervenes
between the road and the Vallum, which has
evidently made a bend to the south to avoid the
hill.
</p>

<p>
Passing Halton Red House, with its beautiful
beds of wallflowers, I began to look out for signs
of Halton Chesters, where lies the Roman fort of
HUNNUM.  A white gate on the left of the road
opens on to a lane through a field; the lane is
bordered by gnarled and twisted trees, and leads to
Halton Tower and the village.  This is our indication
of the site of the fort, through the midst of
which Wade's Road runs, cutting it clean in halves.
Having this clue, it is easy to recognize in the
pasture to the south of the road the buried
gateways and ramparts.  The ground to the north
was under grass for hay when I was there.  When
it was being dug up many years ago, the foundations
of elaborate buildings were found, and the
hypocausts for heating them.
</p>

<p>
The picturesque Halton Tower, which lies immediately
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
to the south of the fort, is the one remaining
tower of the thirteenth-century castle, built of
Roman stones from the Wall and the fort.  The
present owner is evidently a great lover of flowers.
There are beautiful rock gardens (with a Roman
altar among the rocks) and masses of rock cistus
of every colour, especially a rich rose colour which
was new to me.
</p>

<p>
Regaining the road and continuing westward, I
soon crossed a lovely little ravine, with a stream
flowing along the bottom, and beech-trees arching
overhead.  Its steep sides were decked with
primroses and other flowers of spring.
</p>

<p>
A little farther on there is an interesting
landmark; it is the site of the Portgate, the gateway
through the Wall at the point where the famous
Roman road running north crossed the line of the
defensive barrier.  This road used to be called
"Watling Street," a name which was arbitrarily
and mistakenly conferred on the entire length of
Roman road from London to Scotland by archæologists
of the eighteenth century.  The mediæval
and Saxon name was "Dere Street," and this name
is correctly given to it for the first time in the
1921-22 edition of the Ordnance Survey.
</p>

<p>
William of Malmesbury, writing about 1140 A.D.,
refers to the Portgate, "where there stood a gate
in the Wall, as may appeare by the word, that in
both languages importeth as much."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
</p>

<p>
A small Inn, the Errington Arms, stands on
Dere Street, close to the site of the Portgate.  I
called here to ask for a glass of milk.  There was
no one to be seen inside but a postman, who had
evidently completed his delivery of letters for the
day, and was reclining on the long low window-seat,
in a Panama hat and carpet slippers, reading a
newspaper, with a glass by his side.  I knocked on
the table, and a barmaid appeared, who brought
my milk, but I found I had no change left, so I
was diving into my haversack for a note to change.
Meantime the postman had settled his account, and
the barmaid had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
While I drank my milk, the postman talked very
pleasantly about the state of the roads, and the
weather, and the coal-strike; but when I knocked
on the table to summon the barmaid again, he
said quietly: "You needn't do that; I told her to
take it out of mine, as you hadn't any change."  This
was my first experience of being "treated"
in a public-house!  But the way in which it was done
only made me feel that it was another proof of the
comradeship of the road.  So I thanked him, and
went on my way rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this I heard and saw my first curlew,
a sure sign that I was nearing the moorland; and
these beautiful birds, with their sweet whistling
note, were my constant companions from this
point for many miles onward.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
</p>

<p>
And now I came to a point where both Wallditch
and Vallum surpassed themselves in grandeur.
Hutton writes with enthusiasm of the Vallum,
and is quite poetic in his fervour:
</p>

<p>
"I climbed over a stone wall to examine the
wonder; measured the whole in every direction;
surveyed them with surprise, with delight, was
fascinated, and unable to proceed; forgot I was
upon a wild common, a stranger, and the evening
approaching.  I had the grandest works under my
eye, of the greatest men of the age in which they
lived, and of the most eminent nation then existing;
all which had suffered but little during the
long course of sixteen hundred years.  Even hunger
and fatigue were lost in the grandeur before me.
If a man writes a book upon a turnpike road, he
cannot be expected to move quick; but, lost in
astonishment, I was not able to move at all."
</p>

<p>
The effect when I saw it was heightened (if such
a thing were possible) by the marvellous clothing of
gorse, glorious clusters of gold, as if Nature herself
desired to do honour to this great achievement.
</p>

<p>
From the top of the next hill the Vallum can
be seen to perfection, running up the slope of the
hill facing us; nowhere is it better.  Soon after
this, the distant hills come into view, over the tops
of which we are to follow the Wall.
</p>

<p>
Just before reaching the eighteenth milestone,
another mile-castle can be very distinctly traced.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
</p>

<p>
Here again the sight of the gorse was something
too much for words.  The north bank of the Wallditch,
which is very high just here, was one blazing
mass of gold, facing south, and with the sun full
upon it, while primroses and celandine starred the
turf at the bottom.  I got over the fence and walked
along the glacis.  The facing-stones were to be
seen then on the northern face, several feet high.
It may be the dry weather was specially good for
the gorse.  Certainly the hot sun brought out to
perfection the sweet almond scent, and the bees
appreciated it as much as I did, droning in and
out of the blossoms in their hundreds.
</p>

<p>
It was simply baking on the road; the time was
midday, and there were hardly any trees at all;
only the long white road stretched out before me,
going up and down, up and down, in straight,
relentless lines.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the road to examine the Vallum near
a small plantation of fir-trees, I caught sight of a
column of smoke curling up from behind a low
gorse bush.  Yes, there was no doubt about it;
the bush was on fire!  It could not have been
burning long, but the fire seemed to be spreading
rapidly, running along the dry grass, which burned
like tinder.  I broke off some green elder-boughs
from a bush in the ditch, and began to beat the
fire, continuing till I had got it under enough to
be able to stamp upon it; but it was half an hour
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
before I was satisfied that it was dead.  It was
by bringing water in my hands from a tiny stream
that I finally finished it off.
</p>

<p>
Nearly at the nineteenth milestone there is
another mile-castle.  It is just where the hawthorn
hedge on the left stops, and a fine row of beeches
begins to shadow the road.  How welcome their
shade was!  The view to the south from this spot
was glorious.  And gorse again!  The Vallum was
a "Field of the Cloth of Gold," seen against the
blue background of the hills to the south of the
Tyne.
</p>

<p>
A little farther on, at St. Oswald's Hill Head,
a centurial stone is to be seen, built into the
farm-house, on the extreme right, high up near the eaves.
It is blacker than the other stones, and not easy to
find without directions.  The patient daughter of
the house saw me, from the window, looking for
it, and came out to point to the right one, a kind
office she must often have to perform during the
summer months.
</p>

<p>
On a little hill to the north of the road is
St. Oswald's Church, supposed to be built on the very
spot where Oswald, the Christian king of Bernicia,
set up a wooden cross before meeting in battle the
Welsh king, Caedwallon, in 635.  Bede tells us the
story.  Holding the cross with both his hands
while the earth was thrown in to set it fast, the
King cried to his army: "Let us all kneel and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
jointly beseech the true and living God Almighty,
in His mercy to defend us from the haughty and
fierce enemy, for He knows we have undertaken
a just war for the safety of our nation."
</p>

<p>
This speech might be taken word for word from
a modern newspaper's report of an appeal from
the pulpit during the recent war.
</p>

<p>
Though Oswald had but a small army compared
with that of his enemy, yet he won a complete
victory.
</p>

<p>
Bede goes on to say:
</p>

<p>
"The place in the English tongue is called
Heavenfield, or the Heavenly Field, which name
it formerly received as a presage of what was
afterwards to happen, denoting that there the heavenly
trophy would be erected, the heavenly victory
begun, and heavenly miracles wrought to this day.
</p>

<p>
"The same place is near the Wall with which
the Romans formerly enclosed the islands from
sea to sea, to restrain the fury of the barbarous
nations, as has been said before."
</p>

<p>
The little church presents a very modern appearance
now, and there is no necessity to ask for the
key, for the whole interior is revealed at a
glance&mdash;through one window.
</p>

<p>
As I climbed the hilly field in which it stands,
a mother and three children were toiling on ahead
of me, three chubby children, with bunches of
bluebells, and campions, and buttercups flagging
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
in their hot little hands.  They had walked some
miles, I found, to lay these wild flowers on a grave
behind the church&mdash;one of the many customs
which we are apt to forget we derive from ancient
Rome.
</p>

<p>
On the south side of the road, opposite St. Oswald's,
is a field called Mould's Close, where
tradition says that the hottest part of the battle
was fought, and where, in witness, the plough has
turned up skulls and sword-hilts.
</p>

<p>
Still farther south is Fallowfield Fell, where there
is a series of Roman quarries, and a "written
rock."  Flavius Carantinus, a quarryman, left his mark
there: "PETRA FLAVI CARANTINI."  An old
woman outside a cottage directed me where to
find the rock, telling me it was near some "old
wawkins."  The Northumbrian country people so
often elide the letter "r" and the final "g."  One
man puzzled me very much by talking about the
"'Omans;" not till I had been listening to him
for five minutes did I realize that he meant the
Romans!
</p>

<p>
I found the old coal shaft, but I had some difficulty
in finding the stone, and when found it was hardly
decipherable.  So many other people had wanted
to claim the stone of Flavius, for no other reason than
because he had claimed it, and had written their
names beside his, when there were any number of
unclaimed stones to be had!  Well, that's the way
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
of the world, I suppose; the way of the spoilt
child, who only waits to see his brother pick up a
pebble, and then wails: "<i>I</i> wanted that."
</p>

<p>
However, it was worth anything to have come;
the outlook is so beautiful from Fallowfield Fell;
and the beautiful name suits it.  It is a wide
heathery expanse, flecked by cloud-shadows, as I
saw it, and sloping steeply down towards Hexham
and the Abbey, which lie, tree-surrounded, at the
foot of the Fell.  And beyond the Tyne, hill upon
hill recede into the distance as far as the eye can
follow.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
BRUNTON AND THE ROMAN BRIDGE
</h3>

<p>
Returning to the road, the next landmark
I saw was a mile-castle, just visible by a
field-gate on the right.  Black Pasture
Quarry is also on the right.  Here the Romans
obtained much of their sandstone for the Wall,
and for the Roman bridge at Chesters.  Now there
are mountains of broken fragments, covered more
or less with a grassy growth, and shadowed by large
trees, with paths winding in and out.  It is a
queer-looking place altogether, and worth a visit.
</p>

<p>
Just about here the Wall crosses the road from
right to left; and before we reach the twentieth
milestone, a good strip of it is seen in a field on the
left belonging to Plane-trees Farm.  Some of the
facing-stones are still in place, but it does not look
as if they could long remain so, for thorn-trees,
with gnarled and twisted stems, are growing along
the top, thrusting their great sinewy roots between
the stones, and pulling the Wall to pieces.  This
is the piece of Wall which, in 1801, just before
Hutton passed, was 224 yards long and 7½ feet high.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
He saw it being taken down to build a farm-house.
His tears and entreaties prevailed to save the next
piece on our road&mdash;so says local tradition.  This is
in the grounds of Brunton House, hidden in trees
and shrubberies on the left.  I applied at the house
for permission to see the Wall, and the little maid
who came to the door said pleasantly, "Oh yes,
you can see it; but there's really nothing to
see!"  Her conception of "nothing" was evidently quite
different from mine, for I found a great deal to see.
First, there was the Wall-ditch, which is very bold
in its proportions.  It was full of rhododendrons,
azaleas, and forget-me-nots.  The path leads
through a wicket-gate right into and along the
ditch, and brings us to the Wall.  It is a magnificent
piece of Wall!  It is 7 feet high, with nine courses
of facing-stones in place on both sides, and it must
be 60 feet long at least.  Yew-trees, hawthorns,
oaks and nut-stubs are growing on the top.  Two
altars lean against the north face.  I climbed the
Wall, with religious care not to disturb a stone, and
found myself standing above the first turret we
have come to, and perhaps the finest there is to see.
It is 12½ feet by 11½ feet in plan.  Its north wall
is eleven courses high, rising to a height of 8½ feet.
It was so smothered in nettles that I could not
examine it at all closely, but I could see in what
excellent preservation the stone-work still is.
Jumping down into the adjoining meadow, I followed the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
Wall, till it ended abruptly at the angle of the
grounds; but I could see that it was making straight
for the Roman bridge at Chesters, striking boldly
away from the high road for the first time since
Newcastle.  I followed its course to the bottom of
the meadow, then through the field gate, and across
the road leading to Hexham, into the meadows
opposite, and so to the railway line.  A short
distance beyond the railway the Wall joins the
Roman bridge, which passed over the North Tyne,
and led straight to the fort of Cilurnum.  The
remains of the Roman bridge are fenced in, to
protect them from rough usage, but the defences
are not impregnable; there are many gaps in the
hawthorn hedge.  Just inside the hedge the Wall
is seen joining the stone abutment of the bridge,
having here a width of over 6 feet.  It ends in a
square tower on the abutment, a tower rather larger
than an ordinary wall turret.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bruce calls this bridge "the most remarkable
feature on the whole line of the Wall," and it
is wonderful, though I confess I was disappointed
with it at first for not presenting greater possibilities
for a picture.  Trees and plants had so grown up
round it that when I first saw it it looked smothered,
but in preparation for the Pilgrimage of the
Archæological Societies, the scythe was very busy
in September 1920, and it has since been more
visible.

</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
</p>

<p>
Stukeley, who travelled along the Wall in 1725,
speaks of "a wonderful bridge of great art, made
with very large stones, linked together with iron
cramps fastened with molten lead."  Hutton does
not appear to have taken the trouble to turn aside
to look for it, but kept straight on across the bridge
at Chollerford.  Until 1860 the remains were
completely buried in silt from the river, but were then
excavated by Mr. John Clayton, "of happy memory."
</p>

<p>
There are remains of two bridges.  The first was
much narrower than the later one, only about half
as wide.  The later one was wide enough to take
the Military Way (normally 18 to 20 feet).  Both
bridges rested on stone piers in the bed of the
stream, and it is from the remains of these piers that
the width of each bridge can be ascertained.  They
have pointed ends, technically known as "starlings."  The
earlier piers were pointed at both ends;
the later ones only at the up-stream end.  There were
three piers to the later bridge, thus leaving four
water-openings.  One theory is that the course
of the river changed between the building of these
two bridges, and so necessitated a reconstruction,
the earlier bridge being possibly Hadrian's, and the
later one constructed by Severus when he repaired
the Wall.  This would assume that the river had
altered its course a great deal in the ninety years
between Hadrian and Severus.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
</p>

<p>
Another theory ascribes the original bridge to
Agricola, on the supposition that he built the first
fort at Chesters, where some pottery, which appears
to be of earlier date than Hadrian, has been found.
In any case this earlier bridge was built before the
Wall was thought of.
</p>

<p>
Mr. F. G. Simpson's suggestion is that it may have
been part of Hadrian's original scheme of Forts and
Vallum (or "Boundary").  With the building of
the Wall the bridge would have to become
"defensive," and it would be necessary to make the
water-passage as short as possible.  It would no
longer be a matter of indifference, as when it merely
served as a passage-way and a boundary-line.
Hence the very massive later abutments, to narrow
the width of the river-passage; and this would
sufficiently account for the fact that one of the
water-piers of the older bridge is embedded in the masonry
of the east land abutment of the later one.
</p>

<p>
The course of the river has changed since Roman
times; it has swerved to the west, so that the
western abutment is quite under water, and the
eastern one is high and dry, and separated from the
river by quite a mountain of silt, overgrown with
grass and trees.
</p>

<p>
The stones of which the abutments are built are
very massive, one of them measuring nearly 5 feet
in length.  They must have been brought from
the Black Pasture Quarry.  Many of them have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
lewis-holes in them, for lifting; some of the holes
have been filled up with cement.  The earlier parts
have no lewis-holes in the stones, which were
evidently put in position by hand.
</p>

<p>
A continuous iron cramp follows the outline of
the abutment where it faces the river, being anchored
inward by iron bars.
</p>

<p>
That Severus did repair the bridge there is little
doubt, for the feather-broaching which is characteristic
of his period is to be seen on some of the stones.
</p>

<p>
One of Trajan's coins shows a bridge with wooden
arches.  The later bridge may have been like this,
or they may both have been flat wooden platform
bridges.  It is clear that some means of closing
each of the four water-openings by a kind of
portcullis would be necessary to prevent the passage of
an enemy when the stream was low.  In times of
"spate," these portcullises would have to be raised.
A peculiar barrel-shaped stone, 4 feet long, lying
amongst the ruins, with holes all round for the
insertion of spokes, may have served as a
counterpoise in the process of raising; and two round
stone pillars, the remains of which also lie there,
might have taken a part in the same scheme.  In
Cumberland such a water-gate is called a "heck."

</p>

<hr>

<p>
Remains of piers similar to these at Chesters
have been found at Corbridge, where the Roman
bridge over the Tyne was about 462 feet long, with
eleven waterways, as compared with the four
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
waterways and 184 feet of length between the
abutments here on the North Tyne.
</p>

<p>
The waters of the North Tyne were very "low
and placid" that day, as Dr. Bruce says they must
be if the piers in the middle of the stream are to
be seen.  They also looked very cool and inviting;
and so I soon found myself in the middle of the
stream searching for the piers.
</p>

<p>
There they were, both of them, just where they
were sunk eighteen hundred years ago, with their
pointed ends facing up-stream, to cleave a parting
through the swirling waters when the river "came
down."
</p>

<p>
Then I searched for the western abutment, and
finally landed on the Chesters side of the river,
intending to link up the bridge with the fortifications
there.  But here I was on Chesters ground,
and I had not paid my sixpence!  Visions of tea
at the <i>George</i> also began to rise before me, so
conscience and inclination for once pulling in the
same direction, I put on my shoes and stockings
and made tracks for the <i>George</i>.  I went along the
west bank of the river, and so passed the old
mill-house, partly built of Roman stones, with a
Roman altar built into a wall in the mill-yard,
and a large Roman mortar standing by its back-door.
</p>

<p>
Soon the familiar <i>George</i> came into sight, but the
familiar face of the landlord was not to be seen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
outside.  This was very unusual on a fine day, so
I entered, and turned towards the office, expecting
to find him there.  Two men were seated there,
half buried in papers, and they came forward to
ask my business.  I said I wanted a bed for the
night, and would like to see Mrs. Simmonds.  They
sent for her, and she soon appeared, gave me a.
kindly welcome, said they could quite well take
me in for the night, and surely I must be wanting
some tea?  But the house seemed strangely quiet.
I had my tea alone in the coffee-room, and then I
wrote letters till dinner-time.  One of the maids
came to ask: "Will you be taking
dinner?"  "Certainly," I said, with some surprise.
</p>

<p>
But when I found myself quite alone at dinner,
I knew something was wrong, and I made inquiries
of the waitress.  "Why, yes," she said; "didn't
you know?  Haven't you seen the papers?  Mr. Simmonds
was buried yesterday."  No, I had not
heard; I had seen no papers since I left London,
for I had been on the road all the time.  After
dinner, I hastened to see Mrs. Simmonds, to express
my sympathy, and to explain what must have
seemed my strange behaviour.
</p>

<p>
And so the <i>George</i> has lost its landlord; and
many people have lost a kind friend and neighbour.
From morning to night in fine weather his tall figure
and cheery face, crowned with white hair, were to
be seen outside the <i>George</i>, where he held himself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
ready to extend a welcome to all who came.  He
will indeed be missed.
</p>

<p>
Next morning I started westward again, first to
visit Chesters, within half a mile of Chollerford,
where are the famous remains of tie Roman fort of
CILURNUM.  My plan was to walk every step of
the line of the Wall, as far as possible consecutively,
so now I had to pick it up again on the west bank
of the North Tyne where the Roman bridge had
crossed.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfect morning, with a sweet fresh air,
and great clouds rolling up, from behind which the
sun shone coquettishly at frequent intervals.  The
beeches which here overhang the road were at their
freshest stage of green, having just scattered their
bright russet leaf-caps all over the road, as a carpet
for the wayfarer to tread upon.  The pink and white
leaf-caps of the sycamores made less show, in colour
as in quantity; there is no tree so lavishly clothed
with leaves as is the beech.
</p>

<p>
I once had a little conversation with the genial
landlord of the <i>George</i> about these very beeches,
one evening when he was showing me his garden.
</p>

<p>
He was telling me of the famous people who had
visited the <i>George</i> and signed its visitors' book,
amongst them Bernard Shaw and Rudyard Kipling;
and then he added: "It's a funny thing, but do
you know, Mr. Rudyard Kipling didn't know the
difference between a beech and an oak&mdash;clever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
gentleman as he is.  Would you have believed it?"
</p>

<p>
I said: "What makes you think that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he came up to me, and he said: 'Mr. Simmonds,
you have some very fine oaks in this
part of the country.'  I said: 'They're not oaks,
sir, they're beeches.'  And he said: 'Oh, are
they?'  So you see he didn't know."
</p>

<p>
"But how can you be sure he was not referring
to the oaks, for there are oaks about here too?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no; he <i>meant</i> the beeches right enough."
</p>

<p>
And so we left it at that.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
CILURNUM
</h3>

<p>
It was the late Mr. John Clayton of Chesters
who laid the foundation of the new
knowledge of the Wall which excavation has
brought to light.  As other people collect antiquities
to put in a glass case, so he collected the Roman
Wall.  Whenever a piece of ground along its line
was in the market, he was first in the field to buy
it; and to his zeal and knowledge it is due that so
much has been preserved and excavated.  It was
his life-work.  Therefore it is no mere figure of
speech to say that a visit to the Roman Wall is a
visit to his shrine; and since Chesters was his
home for so many years, the Museum there, and
the very fort of Cilurnum itself are especially
commemorative of him and his work.
</p>

<p>
All the forts along the line follow a general plan,
though each has its distinctive features.  In plan
they are parallelograms, with rounded corners,
enclosed by a stone wall at least 5 feet thick, with
a circumscribing ditch, and with gateways north,
south, east and west.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-085"></a>

<br>
Fig. 8.&mdash;Plan of the Fort of Cilurnum at Chesters. (From <i>Archæologia Æliana</i>.)
</p>

<p>
These gateways have double portals, which were
arched over, and were closed by two-leaved wooden
doors, swinging on pivots shod with iron.  The doors
shut against a stone set up in the centre, or else
against a stone threshold.  The pivot-holes can very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
often be seen, and sometimes the iron sheath is still
in the pivot-hole, although the wooden door has
perished.
</p>

<p>
In the case of this fort of Cilurnum, as also at
Amboglanna, there were six gateways altogether,
two smaller ones to the south of the main eastern
and western gateways; these had only one portal
instead of two.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-086"></a>
<br>

<br>
Fig. 9.&mdash;Fortification Turrets from Trajan's Column. (After John Ward.)
</p>

<p>
A guard-chamber was always set on either
side of each main gateway; there was a turret
just within each rounded corner of the fort,
and intermediate turrets were set along the
walls.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of these turrets may be surmised
from the fortification-turrets shown on Trajan's
column.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
</p>

<p>
Chambers above gateways are also shown on
Trajan's column, which suggest to the mind's eye
a possible reconstruction of the single gateways of
the Wall-forts.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-087"></a>

<br>
Fig. 10.&mdash;Fortification Gates from Trajan's Column. (After John Ward.)
</p>

<p>
It is generally accepted that the twin flanking-towers
of the double fort-gateways, and also the
Wall turrets, were carried up from one and a half
times to twice the height of the wall (whether
fort-wall or Great Wall).  The rampart-walk is reckoned
to have run at a height of from 13 to 15 feet from
the ground, so that it would pass over a gate quite
horizontally, and without steps.  It would be
continued right through the towers and turrets, passing
through doorways in their side walls, and across
the floor of their upper storey.
</p>

<p>
Mr. John Ward (in <i>Romano-British Buildings and
Earthworks</i>, p. 70) calls attention also to a gate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
figured on a mosaic in the Avignon Museum, as
suggesting the possible character of the double
gates on the Wall-line.
</p>

<p>
Frequently the great Wall aligns itself with the
northern wall of the forts, as at Borcovicium,
Æsica and Amboglanna; but sometimes, as here
at Cilurnum, it strikes the fort about one-third
way along the eastern and western walls, leaving
one-third, including a gateway, to project
northwards into the enemy's country.  This looks as if
the garrison could not have lived in a constant
state of warfare.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>

</p>

<p>
Streets run between the north and south gateways
and the east and west, in every case.  Where they
cross are the central buildings, which were called
the "Forum" by Mr. Clayton.  But that is a
civil term.  Probably the more correct term is
"Principia," to indicate the H.Q. building of a
military unit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
</p>

<p>
This always includes an open courtyard, surrounded
by a covered colonnade, the bases of whose
piers are still to be seen here at Chesters, as also
the gutter-stones to carry off the drippings from
the roof.
</p>

<p>
Roofing-tiles are found, made of a grey shaly
sandstone, which would readily cut into thin slabs.
They are almost square, and were hung angularly,
from one corner, on nails driven into wooden beams,
as the rust in the holes still shows.  This kind of
roofing slab is used up to the present day, but it is
hung on a wooden peg.  At one period they used
to be hung on sheep-bones thrust in under the
beams.
</p>

<p>
The Romans also used red pantiles, specimens
of which are found here.
</p>

<p>
The entrance to the Principia always faced the
main gate of the fort (the north gate at Cilurnum,
the east gate at Borcovicium).  At the far end
was a series of five small office-rooms, of which the
middle one was the most important.  It was
the <i>sacellum</i> or Chapel of the Standards, the centre
of the religious life and of the <i>esprit de corps</i>
of the cohort or <i>ala</i> which occupied the fort.
It was a constant feature of all Roman forts.  The
standards themselves, which were deposited there,
were objects of worship.  They bore a medallion
or effigy of the reigning Emperor, and thus these
Chapels were the official centres of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
"Emperor-worship," a cult actively propagated by the
government for political motives.  The fact that Christians
refused to join in this cult, and thereby committed
a political offence, was the initial cause of their
persecution.
</p>

<p>
Here, in the <i>sacellum</i>, the deferred pay of the
soldiers was deposited until it became due to them
on their discharge.  Here also were kept the army
pay-sheets, an actual example of which has been
found in the sands of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
At Cilurnum a strong room has been constructed,
evidently in a later and more disturbed period.  It
is entered by steps leading down from the <i>sacellum</i>,
and lies under the office-room next to the <i>sacellum</i>
on the east, blocking that room in such a way as
to prove it could be no part of the original plan.
Early in the nineteenth century the heavy oak
door of the strong room, studded with nails, was
still in place, but it perished when exposed to the
air.  A slab of stone has been thrown (probably
by invaders) across the flight of steps, so that in
descending them one has to stoop very low.
</p>

<p>
The arched roof of the strong room is formed by
a series of large stones "stepping over" each other;
and its back wall is also "stepped over," so as to
make it incline towards the roof.
</p>

<p>
On my last visit I saw a blackbird's nest neatly
tucked in between the stones of this roof.  It
contained three young ones, with their mouths
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
perpetually open&mdash;creatures of one idea, for the
time.  There had been five eggs, but tourists had
taken two away, as mementoes of Cilurnum.
</p>

<p>
The colonnade of the Principia at Cilurnum
consisted of neat piers made of specially small
stones, instead of the circular columns that are
found elsewhere.  The paving is beautiful; but
there are indications that it covers an earlier floor.
The chamfered bases of the piers go below the level
of the present paving-stones, which may some day
be removed, and the original floor-level reached and
dated.  It would be interesting to see in what
state of preservation that floor would be found.
</p>

<p>
In this outer court there is a round well, still
half full of water; the stones are all the original
Roman work except the top row.  There are "set-backs"
at intervals down the sides of the well, to
form footholds when it was necessary to descend
it.  Its workmanship is beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Another necessary and constant feature in the
inner arrangement of a Roman fort was the pair
of granaries, often set close together, side by side.
These granaries were the strongest of the inner
buildings.  Their walls were thick and heavily
buttressed, and their floors supported either on
dwarf walls, or on pillars, to provide for the
circulation of air underneath them and so prevent
damp.
</p>

<p>
The remains of the granaries at Cilurnum have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
unfortunately been removed; they stood to the
south-west of the Principia.
</p>

<p>
A very important find in a guard-chamber at
Cilurnum was what is known as the "Chesters
Diploma," a bronze tablet, conferring the privileges
of Roman citizenship on certain soldiers who had
earned it by faithful service.  It is now in the
British Museum.  Dr. Bruce gives a full description
of it in his <i>Handbook to the Roman Wall</i>.
</p>

<p>
The barracks are another essential feature of a
Roman fort.
</p>

<p>
At Cilurnum these were situated to the north
of the Principia, and important remains are to be
seen in the north-eastern section of the fort area.
</p>

<p>
There was probably accommodation for six
companies of one hundred men, ten men in a room.
The Asturians who formed the garrison came from a
mountainous district in the north of Spain, where
it is quite as cold as the valley of the North Tyne.
The hardy mountain ponies they brought with
them were known as <i>Asturco</i> by the Romans.
The stables have not been identified.  The
barrack-rooms had a covered way or verandah running in
front, with a series of columns, some of whose bases
remain.  A massive stone gutter runs down the
middle of the street between the barracks.  They
probably had little pent-house roofs.  When the
rooms were excavated they were full of pottery,
bones, oyster-shells, and rubbish of all kinds, giving
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
a very bad impression of the standard of refinement
and comfort of the last occupiers.
</p>

<p>
To the east of the Principia is what is most
probably the residence of the commandant, with
private baths, as well as dwelling-rooms, elaborately
heated by means of hypocausts.  The building was
finely designed and finished.  A beautiful moulding
runs round the base, and also round the buttress.
</p>

<p>
The site of the furnace is close to a large yew-tree;
it is semi-circular, and the fuel for it was wood.  The
hot gases and smoke were drawn under the floors
of the rooms, which were supported on hypocaustal
pillars of burnt clay tiles mortared together, or of
stones such as are used in the walls.  Brick tiles
were used nearest the furnace, because the heat
would have cracked the stone.  Fragments of circular
columns are also used, but these are diverted
from their original purpose.  The floors of the
rooms were of double slabs of stones, cemented
together, so as to prevent the smoke from coming
up through the floors.
</p>

<p>
The tiles were roughened with a tool usually, to
give a grip to the mortar.  Accidental marks,
made on them when wet, are often seen: the
footprints of dogs, dents from the nails of a sandal,
thumb-marks, showing the lines of the skin, and the
mark of a man's bare foot, showing the great toe.
</p>

<p>
The baths had been cemented all over with pink
cement, probably made with brick-dust.  The rooms
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
were plastered inside, and the plaster decorated
with deep red, terre-verte and yellow ochre.
Evidently they had been replastered sometimes over
the paint, and coloured again on the top, just as
we put on successive wall-papers.
</p>

<p>
The level of the floors had been raised nearly
3 feet since the building was first made.
</p>

<p>
Over its ruined walls there grows the pretty little
purple "Erinus Alpinus," which is said by some
to have made a mysterious appearance only since
the excavations were begun.  Did it spring from
seed which had long lain dormant, having been
originally brought from Spain by one of the Asturians
who garrisoned this fort?
</p>

<p>
It is an attractive legend, and I would like to
believe it true; but the hard cold fact is that
somebody remembers its having been deliberately
planted on the ruins after the excavations were
made!
</p>

<p>
A very interesting point which must not be missed
is the way in which the stone thresholds of the
gateways have been worn by the chariot-wheels
passing over them.  It must have been a dreadful
jolt for the occupants to cross these high thresholds
when they were new, but Roman soldiers were of
course above minding little things like that!  The
ruts are just over 4 feet 6½ inches apart, exactly
the distance of the wheel-marks we see in the streets
of Pompeii.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Vallum runs into the circumscribing ditch
at Cilurnum; that is to say, the two ditches coalesce
at the south of the fort.
</p>

<p>
What has been called the Roman "Villa" at
Cilurnum is now definitely recognized as the
bath-house provided for the comfort of the troops,
or perhaps for the officers only.  It is the
best-preserved building on the Wall-line, one of its
chambers still standing twenty-three courses of
stones, or 9½ feet high.
</p>

<p>
The great storehouse at Corstopitum, which
might claim to rival it, is 2½ miles south of the
Wall.
</p>

<p>
There is a great bath-house built for the local
garrison at Ravenglass which is even more striking,
as its walls are standing almost their whole height.
It was excavated in 1881.
</p>

<p>
The position of the buildings at Cilurnum, outside
the fort walls, at the foot of a slope and close
to the river, where the soil has been washed down
and has covered them up, accounts for their excellent
preservation.
</p>

<p>
The baths are entered now (by a flight of wooden
steps) just at the point where the original entrance
doorway stood.  An outer lobby led into what
appears to have been the unrobing and anointing
room, a very large flagged chamber, with seven
round-arched stone niches on the west wall.  There
has been much speculation about their use, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
nothing certain is known, but it is suggested that
they may have been cupboards for the bathers to
hang their clothes in.
</p>

<p>
From this apartment one passes into a lobby, giving
access to the hot rooms, to the right, and to the
cold rooms, with a fountain, to the left.  Straight
forward is the final "rest-and-amusements" room,
which has flues in the form of a cross.
</p>

<p>
Turning out of this is another chamber, also with
cross-flues, and with a semi-circular apse, out of
which opens a splayed window, 4 feet wide.  Roman
window-glass, of a bluish-green, was found on the
ground outside this window.  The glass is not
very transparent, having probably been poured
out on a flat surface when made.  It is very rare
to find examples of Roman windows, because
buildings are hardly ever preserved up to the
window-level.  These walls are twenty-three courses
of stones high, or about 9½ feet.
</p>

<p>
There are two hot rooms, one leading out of the
other, and both heated by hypocausts.  The jambs
of the doorway between them are single stones,
each 6 feet high.  The walls of one chamber stand
7½ feet high.
</p>

<p>
The furnace lies beyond these two rooms and is
immediately behind the wall with the seven niches.
</p>

<br>
THE BATH-HOUSE AT CILURNUM, SEEN ACROSS THE NORTH TYNE.
</p>

<p>
There are remains of the concrete vaultings of
the rooms, and in several instances there are double
thresholds, where the floor levels have been raised.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
We see also drainage arrangements for carrying
the water down to the river.
</p>

<p>
Altogether this is a most interesting building,
and it is a pity that no inscriptions have been
found here which would fix definitely its date and
its purpose.
</p>

<p>
As seen across the North Tyne it is very
inconspicuous, because the grassy river-bank hides it.
The soil having in the course of ages washed down
and buried the building, now that it has been
excavated it stands in a hollow.  However, the seven
arches of the unrobing-room are very plainly seen.
The yew-tree, behind the cows in the picture, marks
the situation of the furnace for the heating
arrangements of the Commandant's house.
</p>

<p>
The western abutment of the Roman bridge can
sometimes be seen in the water under the trees to
the right.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting painting here one day when the
river was very dry; the stones showed me much
more of themselves than I wanted to see.  I said
to myself: "I do wish the river would fill up a
little."  Almost immediately after, I looked up, and
it had filled up a little, just about enough to suit
my purpose.  I hardly had time to be thankful
before it had risen a good deal more than enough,
and in a very short time there was not a stone to
be seen.  This was indeed too much of a good thing!
I realized that the river had "come down," as they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
call it.  It was now rushing madly along, getting
very brown and frothy, and boughs of trees were
beginning to be borne along on its current.  When I
went home to lunch, I met a dead sheep being
carried along, and at the <i>George</i> they told me
that Barrasford Ferry was impassable.  Haughton
Castle had telephoned to say so, and to ask to have
its friends coming by rail stopped at Humshaugh
Station.
</p>

<p>
No wonder ardent fishers are warned to be careful
when fishing in these northern streams.
</p>

<p>
Another day, when I was painting here and the
stream was fairly low, I was entertained by the
antics of a merry party of girls.  They kept crossing
and recrossing the river by means of very inadequate
stepping-stones, and at last two of them
tumbled in.  They made no trouble of it, but took
off their pink cotton frocks and hung them up in a
tree to dry, put on their waterproofs, and went off
to view the fort.  Meantime the cows came down
to the river to drink, and, curious as cows always
are, they began licking the dresses until at last they
licked them off the tree.  I on my side of the stream
was powerless to help.  Finally they went off,
leaving the dresses in a huddled heap of pink, and
wetter than ever, I should think.  I was only
thankful that they had not shared the fate of a blue
woollen motor-scarf on the banks of the Dee, which
was hung over the back of a car by its owner while
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
she went fishing.  She returned to see the last six
inches disappearing down the throat of a cow!
She was left frivolously wondering whether, in
its new sphere of influence, it would turn the
milk blue.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
One more word about Cilurnum.  In the church
at Chollerton, about 1½ miles up the North Tyne
from Chollerford, the columns of the south side of
the nave bear evidence of Roman origin, and no one
who is following the Wall should miss seeing them.
They are round columns, each consisting of a single
stone, and are of the same diameter and general
character as portions of shafts found at Cilurnum.
It is more than likely that they were stolen from
the ruined fort to occupy their present position,
and that to this they owe their perfect preservation.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
WALWICK TO SEWINGSHIELDS
</h3>

<p>
After striking off from the western gateway
of Cilurnum, the Wall appears once again
in the grounds of Chesters, several courses
high, and is then just traceable through the plantation
to the west of the house till we come out on to
the road leading to Walwick.  Here the Vallum is
clearly visible in a field on the left.  The foundations
of the Wall could long be seen in the road on the
rise of the hill towards Walwick, but I doubt if they
can often be seen now.  "A good surface for cars"
is made so that it does not easily wash off, even in
thunder-showers!
</p>

<p>
I did not see them myself; but I have since been
told that, though the north face is very seldom seen,
the south facing-stones can be made out just at the
south edge of the road, unless too much covered by
the wayside grass.  With this hint, my readers
may be more successful than I was in finding them.
Hutton says of Walwick: "The village is delightful,
and the prospect most charming," and this is
as true to-day as it was when he wrote it.  From the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
top of the hill, Hexham, with its towers, the valleys
of the Tyne, and a fine wooded country with hills
beyond are spread out before you.  Presently the
Wall-ditch appears in good condition on the right
of the road.  Nearly opposite the road on the left
leading to Fourstones is a cottage, built entirely
of stones from the Wall.  It presents a very solid
rectangular eastern face, from which four battlements
project, and it is known as "Tower Taye."  A
bit of wall running behind it looked in the distance
like <i>the</i> Wall, so I went to examine it.  As I drew
near the house, which lies in a field a little way back
from the road, I noticed that the gate into the yard
was merely the head of an old iron bedstead,
originally painted green.  One castor remained&mdash;on the
loose leg; the other leg was tied, at top and bottom,
to the wooden gate-post, and its foot sunk deep into
the soil.  It made a decidedly original gate!  A
huge sow, with a litter of young ones, had flung
herself down in front of this gate, as though to act
as a watch-dog.  A large tin basin, full of dirty
soap-suds, stood in the middle of the path to the
front door, which was a heavy oaken one, thickly
studded with nails.  Altogether the place struck
me as being a very well-defended Tower!
</p>

<p>
The wall behind was not <i>the</i> Wall, so I came away.
As I emerged on to the road, a young man was
passing in a light cart.  He pulled up and asked if I
was going far.  I said I was following the Roman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
Wall.  "Well, I could have given you a lift.  It's
not much of a trap; I only bought it yesterday at a
fair, and one of the wheels is a bit shaky, but I don't
think it will come off."  I should not have minded
the rickety cart, but "lifts" were not in my line
just now; so I thanked him, saying I was pledged
to walk, and he drove on.  Shortly afterwards two
caravan-carts passed.  One was covered at the
back with red-brown tarpaulin, from under which a
fat brown baby could be seen, lying asleep.
</p>

<p>
As I reached the top of the hill, I saw a boy
leaning against the stone fence, so I asked him if he
could tell me whether I was near the piece of Wall
on Black Carts Farm.  He said: "D'ye see that
bit dene in the field yonder?  That's the Wall."  And
he pointed on ahead, to a field on the right.
The "bit dene" was a hollow, filled with trees and
undergrowth, running parallel to the road through
a field of young corn.  At the very top of the hill
on which I stood there is a young plantation, and
just beyond it a stile on the right leads by a little
path to the site of a mile-castle.  From this point
I found that, for the first time, I could walk
continuously along the line of the Wall as it ran through
the grass.  The "bit dene" still lay ahead.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfect "Wall-day," and both Wall and
Vallum were traceable to perfection in front of
me, one on either side of the road, right up to the
top of the steep Limestone Bank.  At my feet
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
were purple orchis growing in the young bracken,
and the whole countryside was clothed in what
Chaucer calls "the gladde brighte grene" of spring.
</p>

<p>
Following the line of the Wall, I soon came to
the "bit dene" on Black Carts Farm, where there
is a very fine piece of Wall standing, and also a
considerable portion of a Wall turret.
The facing-stones of the Wall are in position on both sides
for a considerable distance, and to a height of
7 feet.  In the turret were found coins of
Constantine the Great, showing that it was not disused,
as some of the recently examined turrets were,
when the Wall was reconstructed by Severus,
about A.D. 207-10.
</p>

<p>
The wild flowers in the "bit dene" were very
lovely and varied: bluebells, cowslips, campion,
wild garlic, cranesbill, herb bennet, sweet woodruff,
the great stitchwort, and purple orchis were all
growing in profusion.
</p>

<p>
Still following the Wall, I crossed a lane known
as "Hen Gap," and began to climb the hill called
Limestone Bank, where another fine piece of Wall
is standing, overhung with gorse, now in full
blossom.
</p>

<p>
The Vallum-ditch is very remarkable in this
region; and hazel, hawthorn and mountain-ash
trees grow on its steep sides.
</p>

<p>
Looking back from Limestone Bank, you can
see the Wall and the Vallum very clearly, running
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
one on either side of Wade's Road.  The mile-castle
mentioned on <a href="#P102">page 102</a> lies close to the road
on the left, just where it disappears over the
hill.
</p>

<p>
I was first brought to this spot with my painting-things
by friends in their car, and just as we reached
it I saw on ahead, walking along the line of the
Wall, a hatless, stockingless, shoeless figure, with
a haversack on its back.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" I cried; "there's a real 'Pilgrim of
the Wall.'  Take me on another half-mile, and
I'll walk back and meet her."
</p>

<p>
They did so, but the Pilgrim disappeared behind
a stone fence before we passed her.
</p>

<p>
When I met her she was not at all the strong-minded
female I had expected to see, but a gentle-looking
young thing, a school teacher from Newcastle,
and it was sheer timidity that had made
her hide behind a wall when she saw us coming.
</p>

<p>
However, she was delighted to have some one
to talk to when she saw I was not shocked at her
bare feet!  She told me she was walking from
Hexham to Crosby-on-Eden, and hoped to sleep
at Gilsland that night.  As for the Wall, she knew
very little about it, but she hoped to learn more on
the way.
</p>

<p>
At the top of Limestone Bank I found a pictureesque
encampment by the side of the road.  Four
horses were tethered, cropping the grass, while
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
two mothers and a swarm of children out of the
caravan carts were busily employed in lighting a
fire in the shelter of a little copse.  Two men were
collecting fuel, and in one of them I recognized
the young man of the light cart.
</p>

<p>
The women greeted me cheerily.  They were
making for Appleby Fair, and reckoned on doing
about 20 miles a day.
</p>

<p>
A mile-castle is easily distinguished on the right
of the road, just opposite where the plantation
ends.  A piece of its wall has been uncovered.  The
military way is specially worthy of notice here,
coming up to the south gateway of the mile-castle,
for it is the first time we have come across it, with
its curved surface and stone kerbs.  We shall
very frequently meet with it, where the Wall
runs over the heights.
</p>

<p>
From this summit can be noticed for the first
time the curious formation of the hills in these
parts, sloping up gradually from the south, and
ending precipitously on the north, for all the world
like a breaking wave; following each other also
just like a succession of waves.  The Romans made
good use of this formation, planting the Wall and
their forts on the very highest ridges, wherever it
was possible.
</p>

<p>
The Wall-ditch and the Vallum-ditch demand all
our attention just over the crest of Limestone Bank.
They have been cut through the solid basalt rock,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
and huge boulders lie about still, just as they lay
when the Roman workmen left them.
</p>

<p>
Peewits and curlews now began to be very plentiful
on this open moorland, the former flying round and
round me, with their plaintive cry, fearful lest I
should track their nests.  I noticed how difficult
it is to see their crests when they are flying; they
lay them back so close to their heads.  I suppose
they would otherwise retard their flight.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of crests, reminds me of an old lady
who takes in visitors along the line of the Wall,
and who has been heard to say that she much
prefers to have "crested people" to stay with her!
</p>

<p>
The west wind was getting stronger and colder as
I walked on.  Great pillars of cloud stood up against
the deep blue sky to the north-west; while on the
south-west, over Tindale Fell, it was raining hard.
</p>

<p>
The next farm-house is Carrawburgh, and near
here lay the Roman fort of PROCOLITIA.  A
mile-castle is seen on the left just before we come
to the fort.
</p>

<p>
There is very little indeed of Procolitia to be
seen on the surface.  The famous well of the
water-goddess, Coventina, is merely a patch of rushes
railed round, and too wet even to be examined.
It is just possible to make out the walls and
gateways of the fort under the grass.  The great Wall
joined on to the north wall of the fort.  The
Vallum curves round to the south to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
</p>

<p>
The first cohort of the Batavians was stationed
at Procolitia; and the Tungrians were stationed
at the next fort, Borcovicium.  This is significant,
because Tacitus mentions that Batavians and
Tungrians fought side by side in Agricola's army
when he won the battle of Mons Graupius.  So it
seems that they first came to Britain under
Vespasian.
</p>

<p>
After we have passed the farm-house of Carraw,
built by the monks of Hexham for a summer residence,
Sewingshields comes into full view, nestling
in trees, exactly over the top of the next hill in the
road.  The land has now become still more bleak
and barren; there are no longer fresh green pastures,
but brownish sheep-moors, dotted with tufts of
rushes and coarse grass.  Presently I saw
something dark sticking up in the long grass by the
side of the road.  I was meeting the wind, so I
got quite close before it moved.  It was the two
dark ears of a hare which sped like lightning, when
it saw me, under a five-barred gate on the right,
and so across the moor, till it vanished, as a speck,
over the horizon.
</p>

<p>
And now at last the Wall leaves Wade's Road,
so I climbed over the stone fence which bounds the
road to walk on its grassy mound.  It diverges
more and more from the road, and makes straight
for where the crags begin at Sewingshields.
</p>

<p>
It soon brought me to a very interesting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
mile-castle which has been excavated.  The northern
gateway is the first good specimen of a mile-castle
gateway that we have come to.  It is fenced round
to protect it from animals.  I clambered over the
stone dyke and down into the Wall-ditch, to gaze
up at the massive masonry, which looks much more
imposing seen from the north.  Nine courses of
stones are in place on the western side of this
gateway.
</p>

<p>
There were now two stone dykes between me and
Wade's Road.  The Wall-ditch continued to be
very deep and striking.  Flags and water-reeds
covered its bottom, and great boulders lay strewn
about.
</p>

<p>
At a fir-plantation the Vallum crosses Wade's
Road, and from this point onwards it runs along
in the low land while the Wall clings to the
heights.
</p>

<p>
On this May day the brown moorland to the
north of the Wall was thickly sprinkled with cotton-grass,
its downy white heads giving a silvery sheen
to an otherwise dull expanse.  "Moss-troopers,"
the children call them, a white army invading from
the north!  Or, as a farmer's wife put it to me:
"They bits o' flooff would mak' ye think we'd had
a shower o' snaw."
</p>

<p>
And so I came to Sewingshields, where the most
fascinating part of the walk begins.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>

<br>
Fig. 12. CONTOUR OF THE WALL RIDGE, <br>
FROM SEWING-SHIELD TO THE NINE NICKS OF THIRLWALL, <br>
AS SEEN FROM THE TOP OF BARCOMBE
</p>

<p>
Hitherto I had had to keep almost entirely to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
Wade's Road.  Now, good-bye to the high road, and
hurrah for the heights!
</p>

<p>
Not till we come to Birdoswald, full 13 miles
ahead, is it necessary to follow a road again; and
even then, after 3 or 4 miles of road, the path lies
mainly through fields as far as Burgh-by-sands.
</p>

<p>
The house at Sewingshields is now used as a
shooting-box by Mr. Charles Straker of High
Warden, near Hexham.  It is built entirely of
Roman stones, so it is not surprising that there is
very little Wall left in its neighbourhood.  The
centurial stone, which Dr. Bruce mentions, has
been taken out, and is preserved inside the house,
where it was shown to me.
</p>

<p>
The fir-plantation which now shelters the house
from the north winds is only of comparatively
recent planting.  It must have been bleak indeed
up there without this protection.  The plantation
is entered by a stile, just on the site of the Wall,
and this is really where the crags begin.
</p>

<p>
Let us sit a moment on this stile and look back
the way we have come.
</p>

<p>
The ditch of the Vallum and its triple mounds
are very clearly marked on the right of Wade's
Road, and the Wall-ditch is very plainly visible on
the left.  The low rays of the sun cast shadows
which emphasize the form, and all round the eye
can follow wave upon wave of undulating ground,
right into the dim blue distance.

CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
SEWINGSHIELDS TO HOUSESTEADS
</h3>

<p>
The path from the stile takes us, behind the
house of Sewingshields, along the very
line of the Wall, until we emerge from the
trees by another stile, and find ourselves, as it were,
on the very Roof of the World, with steep crags to
the right, and long-drawn-out slopes to the left,
and magnificent views all round.
</p>

<p>
To the north lie what are called "The Wastes,"
with only scattered farms and sheep-moors; a
desolate-looking country, I grant you, in dull
weather, but a very fairyland as seen from the
Wall on an ideal "Wall-day," when its vast expanse
is flecked with blue cloud-shadows, reflecting the
blue of the sky overhead, and when the little hills
seem to "rejoice on every side."
</p>

<p>
I think I love this view to the north, bare as it
is, even more than the one to the south, over the
fertile Tyne valley.
</p>

<p>
An ideal Wall-day is a day of mingled cloud and
sunshine, with a bit of a breeze, and yet not enough
to make it "windy;" a day when heavy cumulus
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
clouds marshal themselves along the horizon, and
then spread, and scatter, and form again, always
threatening to do something great, but always
thinking better of it; a day when it is perhaps
raining heavily over Barcombe, or over Tindale
Fell, and rainbows are chasing each other across
the rolling fells to the south; but when "the top
of the world," where we follow the Wall, is peaceful
and calm in the sunshine, sweet with the smell of
the wild thyme as we tread it under our feet, and
musical with the notes of the curlews.
</p>

<p>
I have known many such days.  On such a day
one is inclined to feel that the lot of a Roman sentry
on the Wall was to be envied, until one remembers
the other side of the picture&mdash;the drenching rain,
the bitter wind, the snowdrifts, to say nothing of
the constant sense of the need for vigilance, and the
actual encounters with an unscrupulous enemy.
</p>

<p>
Here at Sewingshields we are farther from shops
and civilization than at any other point on the
Wall.  It is 5 miles to Haydon Bridge, the nearest
post-office.
</p>

<p>
The name "Shield" or "Shields" occurs so
often along the line of the Wall that it is interesting
to see how Camden uses the word in 1599.  He
says:
</p>

<p>
"Here every way round about in the Wasts,
as they tearme them, as also in Gillesland, you may
see as it were the ancient Nomades, a martiall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
kind of men, who from the moneth of Aprill into
August, lye out scattering and summering (as they
tearme it) with their cattell, in little cottages here
and there, which they call Sheales and Shealings."
</p>

<p>
Sewingshields is said to mean "wellings by the
seugh (or ditch);" but Camden calls it "Seaven-shale,"
so it may have merely meant "Seven
cottages."
</p>

<p>
All the 10 miles from Sewingshields to Carvoran
the Wall runs along the tops of "basaltic columns,"
huge pillars of volcanic rock crystallized in
hexagonal formation, and making a great natural barrier.
The course of the Wall is mainly in a westerly
direction, but it also has a general tendency towards
the south.  Carvoran is just 3 miles farther south
than Sewingshields.
</p>

<br>

ALONG THE TOP OF WHICH THE WALL RUNS. <br>
HOT BANK CRAGS ARE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE
</p>

<p>
A steep pass leads down to the plain shortly after
we cross the stile from the Sewingshields plantation.
This is called Cat Gate.  When I was staying in this
neighbourhood the farmer told me it was the only
point where the Sewingshields Crags could be
ascended or descended.  I did not dispute it, but I
smiled to myself, for during my wanderings I had
many times gone up and down the Crags at other
points.  I used to love to sit half-way down the
Crags and watch the rabbits, who got so used to me
that I believe they only thought of me as a queer
kind of a rock.  When I was sketching I used to see
hundreds of rabbits sitting about, one on every
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
projecting rock below me.  The Crags swarm with
them.  One evening an old father rabbit showed
his unconcern at my presence by sitting up a few
feet off, scratching his front abstractedly with his
fore-paws while he looked at me, as much as to say,
"I know what you are."  Just then I gave an
unfortunate sneeze, and it seemed to set all the crags
in motion.  The <i>thump, thump</i>, of the parental
hind-legs, warning their subterranean families of
danger, sounded on every side.  It is a great proof
of family affection that these older rabbits will stop
in the danger-zone and <i>thump</i>, as they do, thus
losing precious time that might be occupied in
flight.  The first time I saw this process, I thought
my friend the rabbit had been seized with a sudden
nervous affection, but I soon found it was only
obeying a universal instinct; and even hutched
rabbits, after generations of domesticity, and with
their families safe by their sides, will carry on the
tradition, and <i>thump</i> on the floor of their hutches,
to give warning of danger.
</p>

<p>
Once at the top of Cat Gate I found a pocket-book,
almost hidden in the heather.  I picked it up, and
could see it contained a sheaf of Treasury notes.
An hour or so later I saw a young man coming
slowly along at the foot of the Crags, looking
distractedly from side to side.  I stood up, and
shouted, "Catch!" and you should have seen the
way his expression changed as the pocket-book
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
went hurtling through the air!  In these almost
pathless regions it is a serious matter to lose
anything of value.
</p>

<p>
But to return to our rabbits.  The rabbits are
turned into a source of revenue by the farmers.
They increase so rapidly that their numbers have
to be kept in check.  Sometimes a farmer will sell
the "rabbiting" on his farm for the season, for
£50 or so, just as the "shooting" is let.  Then the
rabbit-catcher makes what he can out of it.  At
other times the farmer will pay the rabbit-catcher
so much for every couple caught, and then sell them
at a profit.  I have known fifty-seven couple to
be caught by one man in a day on Sewingshields
Crags.  You need to look well to your walking when
the rabbit-catcher is abroad, for of course he makes
his loops of wire as invisible as possible, and you
would certainly be brought to the ground if you
put your foot in one of them.  I was very glad that
I never came across a rabbit in a trap, though
I used to see hundreds of traps.  A shepherd told
me that once he saw a pathetic sight: a rabbit in
a trap, still feeding her young ones.  Missing her,
they had crept up out of the burrow, and had traced
her to the trap.  He set her free at once, for she
was not hurt.
</p>

<p>
This has been a long delay on our walk, but it is
so hot that to sit and watch the rabbits will have
done us all good.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
</p>

<p>
There used to be a castle, known as Sewingshields
Castle, in the fields to the north, built there,
it is supposed, to defend this pass of Cat Gate.
The field where it stood is still known as "The
Castle."
</p>

<p>
Continuing along the crags, I soon came to the site
of another mile-castle.  All along here the Wall
is in a very ruinous condition, but one can follow
closely the mound which once was Wall.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the Sewingshields region, we see
ahead an important gap called Busy Gap.
</p>

<p>
Here the Wall bends nearly southward, in order
to avoid Broomlee Lough (which laps the feet of
Sewingshields Crags) and to make for the next
line of crags.
</p>

<p>
Nothing but the foundations remain of the actual
Wall, but stones are piled up roughly on them to
make a field-boundary.
</p>

<p>
It is the interval between the end of Sewingshields
Crags and the beginning of the Housesteads series
which is known as "Busy Gap," for it was a very
weak place on the Wall, and the enemy knew it.
Besides digging the usual Wall-ditch across the
gap, the Romans made an earthern rampart,
triangular in form, as an additional protection.
Camden says of this Gap in 1599:
</p>

<p>
"I could not with safetie take the full Survey of
it for the ranke-robbers thereabout."
</p>

<p>
One evening when I was returning home from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
this spot, quite suddenly the mist came down, and
blotted everything out.  I could not even see the
ground at my feet, and anyhow there is no path to
follow.  So the only thing I could do was to strike
upwards until I came to the mound of the Wall
on the top of the crags, and then to keep along its
south side.  After a while the mist lifted as suddenly
as it had come down, and I found myself within a
stone's-throw of the little plantation at Sewingshields.
</p>

<p>
It is no joke to be caught by a mist on these fells
in the evening; they come down without any
warning, and sometimes last for days.
</p>

<p>
Just beyond the grass-grown site of another
mile-castle the platform of the fort of BORCOVICIUM
comes into view, with the farm-house of Housesteads.
All this time the Vallum can be seen to
the left, traversing the low land between us and
Wade's Road.
</p>

<p>
Following the Wall up and down the steep sides
of two unchristened gaps, I came to a little wood,
which can only be entered and left by climbing the
stone wall which surrounds it.  A few steps beyond
the wood, and there was the "amphitheatre" of
Borcovicium lying before me, where Dr. Bruce
thought that gladiatorial contests were carried on
for the entertainment of the soldiers of the fort.
There was also a splendid stretch of Wall, 8 feet
wide and 6 feet high, with a flat grass-grown surface,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
running along right up to the wall of the fort!
This was indeed worth seeing!
</p>

<p>
I went down into the "amphitheatre," a mere
grassy hollow, where Dr. Bruce says nettles are
usually growing.  I found, not stinging-nettles&mdash;not
the smallest trace of one&mdash;but bright patches
of purple "heartsease," surely a far better omen
for poor suffering humanity!
</p>

<p>
It must have been a cynic who first started the
idea that stinging-nettles were a sign of human
presence.  I would like to think that pansies give
a truer sign; that good "thoughts," instead of
evil ones, are more truly representative of man.
In the way in which heartsease has (apparently)
displaced stinging-nettles here, on the site of many
a bloody contest, let us see a symbol and a prophecy
of the displacement of human hatred and rivalry
by the spirit of fellowship and love.
</p>

<p>
But wait!  I am forgetting.  The "bloody
contests" are a myth.  Professor Bosanquet
trenched the hollow in 1898 and proved it to be an
ancient quarry.  And so it is marked on the new
Ordnance Survey!
</p>

<p>
Now for the first time it was possible to walk
along the top of the Wall, feeling that it was the
very structure built by the Romans, and not a mere
mound.  Soon the course of the Wall was interrupted
by a gateway, supposed, by Dr. Bruce, to
have been made as an approach to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
"amphitheatre," but the probable explanation of its
existence is given on <a href="#P122">page 122</a>.
</p>

<p>
Just here the Wall crosses the Knag Burn, and
it is interesting to note how it crosses, because it
was no doubt the method employed by the Romans
to carry the Wall over every narrow stream.
First, the bed of the stream has been paved with
stone; then low walls, four or five courses high,
have been built along the edges of the stream for a
distance of about 10 feet.  Lastly, large slabs of
stone have been thrown across from wall to wall,
to bridge the stream to a width of 10 feet, and on
this foundation the Wall has been built.  It leaves
an opening for the stream about 34 inches high,
30 inches wide, and 10 feet long, not a very pleasant
passage for one man to squeeze through, even when
the stream was dry, and hopeless for a raiding
band!
</p>

<p>
At this point a notice is posted: "Admission
6d.; parties over 20, 3d. each."  It reminded me
of the old lady who claimed to be so much over
twenty that she ought to be admitted for a penny!
</p>

<p>
The Wall joins the north wall of the fort at its
rounded north-east angle.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
HOUSESTEADS TO PEEL CRAG
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent" style="font-weight: bold">
BORCOVICIUM
</p>

<p>
The fort of Borcovicium was constructed on
the same general plan as that of Cilurnum,
but it presents also a very great contrast
in situation and in its special features.
</p>

<p>
Cilurnum lies in the fertile valley of the North
Tyne; Borcovicium clings to the bleak heights;
but they are alike in the massive nature of their
gateways, in which pivot-holes and wheel-ruts can
still be seen, and alike in the general arrangement
of the Principia and other buildings.
</p>

<p>
At Borcovicium the Principia faces east, instead
of north.  A wide arch covered the main entrance,
and there were two similar arches inside.  There
was the usual outer court, surrounded by a colonnade
which supported a pent-house roof; the inner court,
with a portico; and the series of five small rooms
at the back.
</p>

<p>
In the northernmost room were found over eight
hundred iron arrow-heads and some scrap iron, as if
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
some one had been making arrow-heads here before
the fort was finally deserted.
</p>

<p>
The columns here are round, as contrasted with
the square piers of Cilurnum.  One very beautiful
base is left; it was probably turned on a lathe, as
a pattern, and then the building appears to have
been interrupted, and the other bases were copied
from the first, not very successfully.
</p>

<p>
The storehouses (<i>horrea</i>), for supplies to last all
the winter, have had as usual very thick walls and
buttresses, in order to support the heavy stone
roofs, tiled with stone slabs, to prevent their being
set on fire by red-hot sling-bullets.  The floors were
raised above the ground on squared blocks of stone,
to keep the buildings dry, and so preserve the grain.
In the Middle Ages a circular kiln was made in the
southern granary.
</p>

<p>
The masonry of the gateways at Borcovicium
is particularly massive and beautiful.  The north
gateway opens on to such a steep slope as to render
it practically useless for wheeled traffic.  It has
been suggested that general instructions were
issued, and then carried out <i>au pied de la lettre</i>, even
when inappropriate, under special conditions.  Such
a thing has been known to occur in more recent
military works.

</p>

<hr>

<p>
There is a large stone tank by the north gateway,
the purpose of which is doubtful.  Knives have
been sharpened round the edges, giving it a scalloped
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
appearance, as shown in the picture of this
gateway which faces this page.
</p>

<p>
The so-called "amphitheatre" is seen on the
left&mdash;a grassy hollow in the angle formed by the
Wall and a field-boundary.  The gateway in the
Wall by the Knag Burn is also seen.  In the
distance are Sewingshields Crags with the Wall running
along the ridge.
</p>

<p>
It is probable that it was found necessary to make
the gateway in the Wall by the Knag Burn because,
<i>after</i> the building of the Wall, the only access to
the enemy side would otherwise have been by the
almost impassable north gate.
</p>

<p>
Prior to the building of the Wall the east gate
was the most available route.
</p>

<p>
The gateways have been all more or less filled
up during some period of the Roman occupation,
but the filling-up has been entirely removed.  This
was done in the dark ages of archæology over fifty
years ago, and no records were kept at that time
of the finds and the different floor-levels, by means
of which it is alone possible to learn the period when
the gates were blocked.  At Rudchester they were
filled up in the second century.
</p>

<p>
The barracks were long narrow huts, about 30
feet in width, built to accommodate a hundred men.
They each contained ten or eleven rooms.  Here
at Borcovicium they run along the length of the
fort, instead of crosswise as usual.

</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
</p>

<p>
The long building by the western gateway was
a workshop; part of it was a smithy; there were
traces of iron and coal.
</p>

<p>
The sanitary system was very complete, and is
one of the chief evidences of the high level of
civilization and comfort which Rome demanded for her
soldiers, even at such a remote outpost of the
Empire.
</p>

<p>
The north-east angle tower has been moved
when the Wall was built, in order to be in a better
position for commanding the line of the Wall,
showing that the Wall was not thought of when the
fort was built.
</p>

<p>
The slopes to the south outside the south
gateway were covered with buildings so closely that
there was no room for a man to pass between the
walls of the houses; and to the west there are
signs of terraced gardens, such as are common now
in Italy.
</p>

<p>
There are many traces at Borcovicium of the
occupation of the enemy, during which time he has
destroyed as much as possible of the buildings and
walls; and the Romans on re-entering have built
again on the ruins, without removing the débris.
This accounts for great differences in floor-levels
that are found.
</p>

<p>
I left Borcovicium by the north gate, and followed
along the north wall till I came to a little wood,
which begins just where the fort ends.  The track
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
of the Wall runs through this little wood, almost
hidden in lush and lusty grass, on the extreme edge
of the basalt cliffs, which are very steep again here.
With slight breaks, the best walking is along the
top of the Wall all the way from this little wood
to Rapishaw Gap; and then again from Cat Stairs
to the west end of Peel Crag.  A splendid piece of
Wall is this that we are now traversing!
</p>

<p>
A quarter of a mile from Borcovicium is what is
known as the Housesteads mile-castle, the most
perfect specimen of a mile-castle that can be seen
to-day above ground.
</p>

<p>
As usual the Wall forms its northern wall, and here
it stands fourteen courses, or 9½ feet, high.  The
thickness of the Wall at the north gateway is not
less than 10 feet.  The original opening was 10 feet
wide, and spanned by an arch, the springers of
which are in position still, as also one of the voussoirs;
and one of the voussoirs of the arch of the inner
gateway is placed on the impost of the outer, as
shown in the picture facing this page.  Broomlee
Lough is seen in the distance.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-124"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-124.jpg" alt="THE NORTH GATE OF HOUSESTEADS MILE-CASTLE SHOWING HOW THE GATEWAY WAS NARROWED IN LATTER ROMAN TIMES">
<br>
THE NORTH GATE OF HOUSESTEADS MILE-CASTLE SHOWING HOW <br>
THE GATEWAY WAS NARROWED IN LATTER ROMAN TIMES
</p>

<p>
The inner gateway has been made, at a later
period, by walling up the original one, and so
reducing the width from 10 feet to 3¾ feet, and the
floor has been raised 3½ feet above the original
level.  Everything goes to indicate that the
gateway has been destroyed several times, and that the
Romans have built it up again without removing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
the débris.  This partial walling-up of the gateways
seems to have been done in the case of most of the
forts and mile-castles, in the later period of Roman
occupation, when Rome could not spare many
soldiers for this outlying province.
</p>

<p>
If we examine the north gateway from the north
side it is clear that one of the piers has been partly
overthrown when the enemy was in occupation.
Something has been inserted in the bar-holes, and
the whole Wall has been levered out.  This would
make the arch collapse.  In Severus's reconstruction
the pier has been left thus, pushed out of place,
and has been built round.
</p>

<p>
Severus's reconstructions are much better work
than some of the later ones.
</p>

<p>
Still walking on the Wall, I came to Cuddy's
Crag (Cuddy is a pet name for St. Cuthbert), the
Wall maintaining its full breadth of 8 feet and a
height of 5 or 6 feet for a long distance.  The
picture which faces <a href="#P28">page 28</a> shows the Wall as
seen from Cuddy's Crag, looking eastwards, along
the way we have come.  Wade's Road is seen like
a white ribbon to the left of the trees.  Just below
it is the gateway through the Wall referred to on
<a href="#P122">page 122</a>.  The hollowed line on the extreme left of
the picture, near the horizon, where the Wall makes
a great dip down, is Busy Gap.
</p>

<p>
Over Cuddy's Crag we come to Rapishaw Gap,
where the Wall becomes too steep and rough for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
walking on.  Apparently the mat of turf which
covers it elsewhere could not grow on this steep
slope.
</p>

<p>
Just here I came across a sad sight&mdash;a new-born
lamb with its eyes pierced, evidently by a kite or
some such bird of prey.
</p>

<p>
Next come Hotbank Crags, from the top of which
Crag Lough comes grandly into view.  To the
south of Wade's Road, Barcombe is now prominent,
covered with heather, still in its sombre stage, and
with the Long Stone standing out sharply against
the sky.  Beyond Barcombe the green platform of
the fort of Vindolanda, at Chesterholm, can be
distinguished.
</p>

<p>
Crag Lough is one of the most beautiful natural
features along the line of the Wall.  Lying for its
whole length immediately under the steep basalt
crags, it has the advantage of Broomlee and
Greenlee, which spread themselves out in the plain.
</p>

<p>
Crag Lough is reached through Milking Gap,
which lies between the Lake and the farm-house of
Hotbank.  I tried to get rooms at Hotbank when
I was painting along the Wall, but the family was
too large to allow of their taking visitors.
</p>

<p>
There is a mile-castle in Milking Gap; and thence
the Wall climbs the slope to the summit of
Highshield Crag, where the columns of basalt are
particularly striking.
</p>

THE WALL IS VISIBLE ON THE HEIGHTS ABOVE THE LOUGH, <br>
AND ALSO RUNNING OVER WINSHIELDS.
</p>

<p>
In the picture facing this page, the Wall is seen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
running along the top of Highshield Crag above
the Lough, having passed through the little wood.
</p>

<p>
In the distance it is seen taking its farther course
over Winshields, the highest hill that it traverses.
</p>

<p>
The basaltic columns overhanging the Lough,
and Hotbank farm-house in the distance, are seen
in the picture which faces <a href="#P112">page 112</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is a beautiful walk through the little wood
above the Lough, with its waters seen through the
branches of the trees.  Hosts of jackdaws dwell
in these crags, and keep up a perpetual conversation
with each other.
</p>

<p>
The wind had now dropped, and it was warm
walking on the unsheltered crags.  I had met no
one since leaving Sewingshields, so I took off my
shoes and stockings and walked barefoot on the
grass.  But I kept wanting to cross and recross the
Wall, and to climb stone hedges, and this was not
pleasant with bare feet, so at last I took my
bedroom-slippers out of my haversack, and walked in them for
several miles, till I suddenly found that I had worn
them into holes on the rocks, so they were no longer
any protection!
</p>

<p>
At Steel Rigg Gap the ground falls very steeply,
and the Wall-stones are laid horizontally.  Here in
the gap is a small walled enclosure, with a sycamore
growing in it.  No! it is <i>not</i> a Wall turret, only a
sheep-fold.
</p>

<p>
Now comes Castle Nick, containing a mile-castle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
in very good condition.  It is 50 feet by 62 feet.
Probably the narrowness of the gap explains why its
greatest size is north and south, instead of east and
west, as usual.
</p>

<p>
The south gateway is smaller than the north.
Under the foundations of the south gateway have
been found the pivot-holes of a wider gate.
</p>

<p>
Foundations of buildings are to be seen within
the walls; no doubt they were similar to the barracks
in the stations, and had pent-house roofs.
</p>

<p>
The next gap is called Cat Stairs, where a very
rough and rocky path descends to the plain.
</p>

<br>
CASTLE NICK MILE-CASTLE, WITH CRAG LOUGH IN THE DISTANCE
</p>

<p>
I was coming this way once with my sketching-things
at six o'clock in the morning, and I though
I would go down the Stairs, and get a view of the
Wall from the plains.  My things were heavy, so
I left them at the top, just where a stone boundary
wall crosses the Wall.  Having seen enough, I was
returning, when I heard a noise.  Surely some very
large Cat was coming down the stairs!  Stones were
bounding from rock to rock and falling on the plain.
I waited, and there swung into view a tall young
shepherd with my sketching-things hung round his
neck!  It was amusing to see his astonishment
and confusion.  But I knew at once what had
happened without his needing to explain.  He
thought my things had been forgotten the day before
by some member of a party who had visited the
Wall, for he said he had never before seen any one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
about there so early.  I thanked him for his kind
intentions, and asked him to add to his kindness
by taking the things "upstairs" again.  Which he
did, and I went on my way.
</p>

<p>
And here I must interrupt the Walk for a little
while to speak of life at the lonely farms, where they
so kindly took me in.  Nearly always they said,
"No," at first.  If they gave no reason, or an
incontrovertible one, I went away.  If they said,
"We can't get meat for oorsel's, and we're fair
stoured wi' rabbits," I saw my chance, and protested
that I wanted no meat at all, only eggs and bread
and butter and milk.  Then they usually yielded
at once, with a "Well, ye sanna go hungert!"
</p>

<p>
The middle of May is the annual moving-time for
the farms, I found; so it is a bad time to try to
get taken in.
</p>

<p>
Once they had hardly got straight after a move
when I called, and the good-wife said doubtfully,
"Would ye mind a fixt bed?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear, no," I said gaily, not having the
faintest idea what it was!  But I thought it must
be better than a peripatetic one!  When the time
came, my bed looked very ordinary indeed, and I
was quite disappointed.  I made inquiries, and the
housewife smiled, and said her extra bed had come
by the carrier unexpectedly soon.  "But ye can see
the fixt bed if ye like."  I found it was a two-legged
wooden bedstead forming part of the structure of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
small attic, with the back built against the wall,
and the two legs at the foot immovably glued to the
floor.  Rather nice, when one moves in to a new
house, to find one bed already there!
</p>

<p>
At these "out-by" farms they keep very early
hours; they often have dinner at 10.30, tea at
2.30, supper at 5.30, and go to bed at 7.30.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I would spend a day out with the
children on the moors, or mosses, as they are usually
called, where in places the draining-ditches are so
close together that progress is a perpetual jump.
Or if there are no ditches, it means jumping from one
clump of rushes to the next.  But "nae rash-bush
e'er deceived true Scot," as the proverb says, and
the rush-bushes never let us down, Scots though we
were not.
</p>

<p>
There I saw cranberry-blossom for the first time;
and any amount of milk-wort, all colours, and
butter-wort, and the sticky round-leaved sundew.
</p>

<p>
Once they made me cut a peat, my first peat,
standing by and laughing while I tried my
prentice-hand at it.
</p>

<p>
It looks so easy to cut one of these slices of
"chocolate-mould."  But it isn't!
</p>

<p>
The crust of the ground is hard, and one is apt not
to exert enough force to start with.  Then perhaps
one overdoes it, and goes through the crust all of a
sudden, and so slithering down through the soft
damp peat far more quickly than one intended.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
But they were kind to me, though they laughed.
They said: "She didn't break her first peat; that
was champion!"
</p>

<p>
We would roam on the moors and hear the badgers
barking, and sometimes we would see one; and
we'd go and watch the sheep-washing down by the
"Sike."  There is no end to what one can do in the
country "out-by"!
</p>

<p>
The names of some of the houses are very unusual.
There is "Seldom Seen," a herd's cottage
on the Stanegate; and "Cold Knuckles," an out-by
homestead which was burnt down (in its efforts
to warm itself, apparently) and has not been rebuilt.
A pity that such a name should also perish in the
flames!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
PEEL CRAG TO WALLTOWN
</h3>

<p>
On Peel Crag I was quite delighted with the
Wall.  It stretches for a long distance,
eight or nine courses high and 6 feet wide,
running along the more or less level summit of the
Crag.  I learned afterwards that the upper facing-stones
on the southern side had been restored in 1909,
as nearly as possible in the Roman manner, but that
on the northern face they were untouched.  One
of the men who had helped in this restoration told
me he had spent all the winter on Peel Crag, and
"cawld wawk it was, with the stones."  The south
foundation of the Wall in this stretch stands on a
higher level than the north.
</p>

<p>
If the Wall here had not been carefully restored
it would have to have been replaced by an ordinary
"dry dyke" to keep the sheep from falling down
the Crag, which descends steeply to the north.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-132"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-132.jpg" alt="THE WALL ON PEEL CRAG">
<br>
THE WALL ON PEEL CRAG
</p>

<p>
Investigations on Peel Crag and Winshields have
gone to show that, in Severus's reconstruction of the
Wall, most of the turrets in this neighbourhood
were not restored, but, on the contrary, the insets
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
where they had been recessed into the Wall have
been filled up level with the face.
</p>

<p>
Ten years ago the positions of only five or six
turrets were known along the Wall.  Since then,
over thirty have been found and six excavated.
This leaves many which are still awaiting their
turn to be opened.
</p>

<p>
Peel Crag ends abruptly, and the Wall, after
bending southward, as usual at every gap, strikes
steeply down into the gap, as is shown very clearly
in the picture facing <a href="#P142">page 142</a>.  The advancing
enemy would be subject to a flank attack from the
Roman defenders hidden in the safe shelter of
the Wall.
</p>

<p>
The Wall then turns slightly northward, in order
to gain the top of Winshields.  It is in excellent
condition on the low ground to the north of this
gap, about 6 feet wide and nine courses high, and
makes a good "road" to walk upon.  The Wallditch
recurs here, as always, whenever the Wall
leaves the heights, if only for a few yards.
</p>

<p>
The road which runs north and south through the
gap will take us down to "Twice Brewed," the
Inn on Wade's Road, if we are wanting tea.  I
never found "Twice Brewed" very anxious to
give me tea; I fancy they thought it a lot of trouble
for one.  There is "only one pair of hands to do
everything," so they said.  I asked if I could stay
there for a week while I was painting, but there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
were many good reasons why I could not.  First,
it was the food; so difficult to get.  I said I could
live on bread and butter and eggs&mdash;"and bacon,"
I added, looking at the "backs" and the "streaky"
hanging from the ceiling behind her.
</p>

<p>
"But we want all that for oorselves."
</p>

<p>
"Well, bread and butter and eggs will do."
</p>

<p>
"I must ask 'him,'" said she.
</p>

<p>
And when she did ask "him," he said it would
interfere with his regular customers!  So that
settled it; and I found somewhere in the
neighbourhood that suited me better, and everybody
was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
I stayed at a little farm where the husband
worked "in the pits," and helped his wife with the
farm in his spare time.  The wife was such a neat,
bright, pretty young thing.  The husband was on
night-shifts, and came home for his supper (or was
it breakfast?) at five o'clock in the morning, so
I used to have my breakfast at the same hour, and
get off early.  I think my record-day on the Wall
started at 5.30 a.m. and ended at 10 p.m.&mdash;a long
June day.
</p>

<p>
I used to bicycle along Wade's Road, leave my
bicycle at the farm nearest to where I wanted to
paint, and then walk from point to point along the
Wall, with perhaps four different sketches going on,
at the different periods of the day.  Having started
off one morning at 6 a.m., I wanted somewhere to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
leave my bicycle.  A little house with an enclosed
garden looked suitable, so I jumped off, and then
saw to my amusement that a horse was standing
looking in at the little bedroom window under the
eaves, from which a hurried voice was calling to
him: "I'm a-coming; I'm a-coming."  Presently
an old lady appeared, and I asked permission to
leave my bicycle, saying I should be gone all day.
She answered: "What odds?  A'll be here."  She
then introduced the horse.  "He always looks for
his corn at half-past six sharp."  And I often saw
him after that, at the window.  When I returned
in the evening, rather late, the old lady said: "I
was feart ye was fallen into t' Lough;" and then
she produced my bicycle from a shed: "I thocht
ye didna want yer tyres brusten wi' the sun."
</p>

<p>
But I have wandered a long way from Peel Crag.
I did not need to go to "Twice Brewed" for tea;
I was fortunate in having a friend near by who had
often made tea for me when I was painting on the
Wall.  And to her I went now.  I found she had
visitors.  A great event had taken place in the
neighbourhood the night before; there had been
a local subscription dance in the barn of Twice
Brewed Farm (or East Twice Brewed, as it is
sometimes called.  It was the Inn in Hutton's time).
The people "out-by" had never had such an
opportunity before, though "in-by," at Haltwhistle,
there were dances in plenty.  Three of the dancers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
were calling&mdash;bonny young girls whose first dance
it had been, and they were full of it.  "It was
champion!"&mdash;or "It was terrible nice!" (their
highest terms of praise).  They had breakfasted at
five o'clock in the morning before going to bed.  One
of them had done her hair up for the first time in
honour of the occasion.  "There was a pocket of
hairpins in it, more hairpins than hair, and yet it
wouldn't keep up!"  And so they ran on, while I
enjoyed the "berry-cake" and gingerbread for
which my hostess was famous.  She was busy
making one of the wadded quilts which one sees so
often along the line of the Wall.  And their
rag-carpets, or "stubbed mats," as they call them, are
sometimes like bits of stained glass!  They
frequently dye the cloth themselves, the exact colour
they want, and make very elaborate and rich
designs.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to Winshields, the highest
point to which the Wall rises, 1230 feet above the
sea.  Below, on the left, is a farm-house known as
"The Bog," and south of that, very near to Wade's
Road, runs the Vallum.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to miss the line of the Wall in
the high regions, for it is always on the ridge.
I cycled out one day through Caw Gap to the
hamlet of Edges Green, along one of the little-used
roads that run north into the lonely wastes, in order
to make a sketch of Winshields from "out-by,"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
that is to say, from the country to the north of
the Wall.  I had barely finished this sketch when
a brilliant flash of lightning warned me to move,
and it was soon followed by thunder and heavy
rain.  I found shelter, and a kind welcome (which
included tea, as usual!) in the nearest house.  My
good hostess apologized for having "nothing" to
give me for tea, because she lived so far "out-by,"
but I found an abundant spread&mdash;cheese, jam,
scones, two kinds of cake, and white and brown
bread.  I wondered what "something" would
have been!  When it came to paying, she said:
"Oh, it's nothin'; it's just a drink o' tea."
</p>

<p>
She had lived there twenty-one years, and told
me they were often snowed up in winter and had to
dig themselves out.  "But we're nothin' to some
folks," she added; "we're 'out-by' to Hautwissel,
but we're 'in-by' to Hope-Alone!"  She was
referring to a lonely farm 2 miles farther north,
standing at a height of 900 feet.
</p>

<p>
The works of the Vallum are splendid, as seen
from the top of Winshields; the eye can follow
them for a great distance.  The best developed
section is at Cawfields.
</p>

<p>
And the view is wide and beautiful, especially
on such a changeable day as this, with all round a
tumble of brilliant white clouds on a blue sky, but
with heavy masses of black appearing in the east,
and gradually blotting out the hills.  Presently
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
there is a change; the clouds break, and patches of
sunlight begin to dance on the hills, which but a
moment before were obscured.  The rays of the
sun are like a moving finger, tracing out the form
of distant farm, and tree, and wall, on the hillside,
and then passing on.
</p>

<p>
Then another change: heavy clouds appear to the
north-west, and the rain comes down and blots out
the Solway; which yet again gleams out in a long line
of silver light before another half-hour has passed.
</p>

<p>
From the top of Winshields at midday I have
more than once seen a huge red flare, like an evening
sun, spring up and disappear again almost immediately.
I am told this has been the destruction of
ammunition dumps near Gretna Green.  It must be
a fearsome sight (and sound) at close quarters.
</p>

<p>
The Wall varies very much on Winshields;
sometimes in tolerably good condition; sometimes
a mere ruin.
</p>

<p>
The gaps here are called "slacks," a curious
word, which I heard the people use for any depression
or shallow dell.
</p>

<p>
Green Slack is a depression in the hill where there
are traces of British dwellings; and then there is
Lodham Slack, a deep heathery valley, where for
some distance the Wall-ditch again becomes
necessary, and runs, filled with rushes, on our
right.  There is very little heather along the line
of the Wall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
</p>

<p>
Next comes Shield on the Wall, where there was
a mile-castle, and where patches of rhubarb still
mark the garden of the cottage which was built
of the mile-castle stones.
</p>

<p>
Now Cawfields and the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall
come into view ahead.
</p>

<p>
The next gap is Bogle Hole, with very steep
sides; and Winshields comes to an end at Caw
Gap, where a road runs through to the north.
</p>

<p>
As I descended Winshields, and came down into
the road, it was raining fast on the Nine Nicks,
though still sunny where I stood.
</p>

<p>
The two gaps which follow are Bloody Gap and
Thorny Doors&mdash;names significant of the many
struggles they have witnessed.  No doubt they
were very "thorny" doors to the Picts, who tried
to pass through them from the north!
</p>

<p>
The picture facing <a href="#P152">page 152</a> shows this gap.
The Wall is in a very ruinous condition just at the
gap, but much better preserved on the heights.
The way in which it was made to bend to the south,
to enable the Romans to enfilade the approaching
enemy, is very clearly seen here.
</p>

<p>
Cawfields mile-castle can almost be discerned
from this point, lying on the southern slope, just
before the next gap, Pilgrims' Gap.  In the distance
are seen the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall, over which
the Wall takes its farther course.
</p>

<p>
Seven or eight courses of facing-stones and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
projecting foundations clearly visible gave me great
satisfaction as I continued my way.
</p>

<p>
The wild-flowers were very wonderful, the yellow
cistus, or rock-rose, growing all over the Wall, with
its delicate blossoms and dark silver-lined leaves.
Tall foxgloves sent up their spikes of nodding
blossoms, like stately Roman Emperors, clothed
in the imperial purple, while rosy wild thyme and
blue speedwell prostrated themselves, like humble
courtiers, at their feet.
</p>

<p>
Every writer on the Wall has, I believe, to do his
duty in repeating Sir Walter Scott's verses about
the flowers that grow on it&mdash;once, at least.  <i>His</i>
flowers came from the Nine Nicks, it is said, and
not from this particular spot, but this seems a
suitable opportunity for quoting his lines:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "TO A LADY WITH FLOWERS FROM THE ROMAN WALL"<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Take these flowers, which, purple waving,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ruined rampart grew.<br>
  Where, the sons of freedom braving,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome's imperial standards flew.<br>
  Warriors from the breach of danger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck no longer laurels there:<br>
  They but yield the passing stranger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild-flower wreaths for beauty's hair."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As the ground dips down to the next gap, Cawfields
mile-castle is seen on the slope of the hill.
This was the first mile-castle to be opened, by
Mr. John Clayton, in 1848.  In the following year
Dr. Bruce took a party of pilgrims along the Wall, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
they christened this gap between Cawfields
mile-castle and quarry, "The Pilgrims' Gap."
</p>

<p>
The masonry of both northern and southern
gateways is massive, and in splendid condition.  It
should be studied from north of the Wall also.
The size of this mile-castle is 63 feet by 49 feet.
The pivot-holes of the gates are very clearly
seen.
</p>

<p>
It was now beginning to rain, and by the time I
had got through the gap and into the Cawfields
quarry yard it was coming down heavily, so I
sheltered in the shed of the quarry, which is close
by the Haltwhistle Burn, known as the Caw Burn
between this point and its source.
</p>

<p>
At a bend of the stream are the remains of a Roman
water-mill, such as is described by Vitruvius,
writing early in the first century.  Third-century
pottery has been found there, and a coin of Trajan;
also the remains of the water-shoot.  The mill-stones
are in Chesters Museum.  A little defensive
rampart ran across to protect it, from river to river.
</p>

<p>
We are now also near the Haltwhistle Burn Fort,
which is not a mere temporary Roman camp, as
was supposed, but a permanent fort, with two
branch roads leading from the gates to the Stanegate,
which here crosses the burn.  The headquarters
building, the barracks and other buildings,
and the oven were excavated in 1907 by the late
Mr. J. P. Gibson and Mr. F. G. Simpson.  The fort
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
was dismantled when Æsica, the next fort on the
Wall, was built.
</p>

<p>
Burnhead farm-house is next passed, standing on
the site of the Wall.  The line of the Wall has
verged to the north-west.  The Wall-ditch is our
guide.
</p>

<p>
North of the Wall here there is a large Roman
temporary camp, 9 acres in extent, with rounded
corners, as is usual, and a short ditch across the
gateway-opening, the earth out of the ditch being
thrown up into a mound called a "traverse," to
lie across the opening and hinder an attack.
</p>

<p>
It is worth visiting as we pass.
</p>

<p>
The rain had quite stopped; and, as I pushed on,
I noted the traces of the building crossing the line of
the Wall which was formerly thought to be a
mile-castle.  However, only a few yards away a real
turret has been found.  Shortly after, the Wall
began to be in better condition.  Two or three
courses of facing-stones were in place on the south
face for some distance.
</p>

<p>
Just here a stoat, carrying some sort of gruesome
carcase, passed me, and disappeared into a loosely
constructed part of the Wall.  It ran up and down
inside the Wall, furious with fright, making a noise
like the clucking of an angry hen, and glaring at
me through chinks between the stones.  I fancy it
had a young chicken.
</p>

<br>

SOUTHWARD AS USUAL BEFORE DESCENDING INTO THE GAP
</p>

<p>
I pressed on quickly, for it was thundering in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
the distance, and soon reached Great Chesters,
where the fort of ÆSICA stood.  The farm-house
here had a very beautifully kept lawn in front, and
rows of pink columbines standing up neatly under the
windows, which looked strange, though attractive,
in such a wild spot.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
ÆSICA
</p>

<p>
The chief feature of the fort at Æsica is its
western gateway, which represents the gateway just
as the Romans finally left it.  There has been a
total blocking up of nearly all the gates.  Probably
only a narrow portal was left at the south.
</p>

<p>
The fort-walls were, as is usual, reinforced by
a sloping bank of earth inside, which accounts for
their excellent preservation.  The inner buildings
have been found to be reconstructions of the latter
part of the third century.
</p>

<p>
One of the ditches which go right round the outer
wall of the fort has been found below the foundations
of the Great Wall, showing that the fort was
built some time before the Wall.  Four successive
ditches all appear to go under the Great Wall at
the north-west angle.
</p>

<p>
Extra ramparts of earth were thrown up on the
western side, for additional protection.  The
position of Æsica was very weak on the west before
the Wall was built.
</p>

<p>
A Roman road ran from the Stanegate to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
southern gateway, and again from the western
gateway towards Carvoran.  It can be clearly traced.
</p>

<p>
Water was brought to this fort by the Romans
by means of a very winding aqueduct, 6 miles long,
from the head of the Caw Burn, 2¼ miles away.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-144"></a>
<br>

<br>
Fig. 13.&mdash;Cross-section of Fort-wall, showing how it was reinforced on the inner side with earth.
</p>

<p>
The Wall abuts on the rounded north-west angle
of the fort.  The tower at this angle appears to
belong to the Wall and not to the fort.  It was
evidently rebuilt when the Wall was built, like the
one at Housesteads.
</p>

<p>
The Wall-ditch is very clearly marked to the west
of Æsica.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
</p>

<p>
The remains at Æsica have been fenced round
to protect them from cattle, but the fences are
broken, so when I was there, sheep and lambs were
disporting themselves on the very walls of the
guard-chambers.
</p>

<p>
After passing Cockmount Hill farm-house, where,
in spite of the bleak situation, white lilacs were
blooming in the garden, and the regulation farm-house
sycamore was firmly established, I entered a
dense little wood, and here the Wall was in very
satisfactory condition.  Under the pine-trees it
ran, its lower courses hidden by beautiful ferns and
foxgloves, but I could see the projecting foundation
stones in places.  In the wood I met an old lady,
with two pretty children, from the farm, gathering
sticks.  The children made just the right patches
of colour there amongst the pine-needles, a patch of
purple and a patch of emerald green.
</p>

<p>
South of Cockmount Hill many of the newly
discovered causeways, referred to on <a href="#P134">page 34</a>, can
be seen crossing the ditch of the Vallum.
</p>

<p>
The rain now began to come down in earnest,
and I hurried past the next site of a mile-castle
without even looking at it.  As I reached Allolee
farm-house, I decided I must take shelter.  Two
huge specimens of the pig-tribe saw me coming,
and charged down the hill at me at full speed,
grunting loudly.  It needed all my determination to
keep on in a straight line!  But they faded away,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
with a disappointed look, just before they reached
me.
</p>

<p>
I was most hospitably received at Allolee, hung
out to dry, and fed, and entertained, to my heart's
content.  Two children, a boy and a girl, were with
their mother in the farm-house kitchen.  I told
them the pig-incident, and all the sympathy I got
was: "Poor dears! they were hungry!"
</p>

<p>
The little girl was engaged in cutting out a jumper
for her doll, a very intricate process, and I was
called on to help.  She was very proud of the doll,
and rightly so, for through an unfortunate accident
it had become bald, and her mother had made it a
very neat new wig out of her own hair, with grey
strands in it.
</p>

<p>
The boy had a gramophone, and he selected
"Lead, kindly Light" for my benefit.  I don't
know if he meant it to be appropriate, but it
certainly was.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "The night is dark, and I am far from home.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead Thou me on!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And I could not help thinking how the "kindly
Light" was shining in that remote little farm-house
through the kindness that was being shown to a
stranger.
</p>

<p>
As I sat by the fire, they told me <i>they</i> had no
coal-shortage, because a farmer near them had found
coal on his farm.
</p>

<p>
Presently other members of the family dropped
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
in&mdash;a father, and some older brothers; but still
the rain poured down, and they would not let me go.
Fortunately, I had a shelter for the night awaiting
me, only a mile or so away, and as soon as ever
the rain stopped, I took my leave, very grateful
for all they had done.
</p>

<p>
It is a very short distance from the fir-wood
which shelters Allolee to Mucklebank, the highest
part of the Nine Nicks of Thirlwall, 860 feet above
the sea.  On its western side, just where the Wall
makes its customary bend to the south, to protect
the gap, stands a Wall turret.  Both its northern
and western sides are recessed into the Wall.  It
was uncovered in 1891 by the late Mr. J. P. Gibson
of Hexham.  A rabbit-hole gave him the clue as to
the existence of this turret.
</p>

<p>
Criffel now appears, as a distant peak against
the sky, on the right, and Walltown farm-house is
seen lying ahead on the left, with a beautiful belt
of trees round it.  The gap here is a wide one,
and the Wall-ditch comes into play again as usual.
Signs of the "King's Well" are seen in the gap,
where the rushes grow thick; this is where legend
says some early Christian King was baptized.
Could it have been the baptism of King Edwin of
Northumbria by Paulinus in 627?  It hardly seems
likely, but that is what is suggested, though some
say it was Egbert.

CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
WALLTOWN TO GILSLAND
</h3>

<p>
Walltown farm-house is built on the site
of the Tower where lived John Ridley,
the brother of the martyred Bishop,
who writes to him as "My beloved brother, John
Ridley, of the Walltown."
</p>

<p>
The farmer came and spoke to me while I was
making a drawing of the house from the Walltown
mile-castle.
</p>

<p>
"This is a very historic place.  John Ridley
lived here four hundred years ago, and here am I,
John Ridley, living here still."
</p>

<p>
In Haltwhistle Church, only 3 miles away, there
is a very interesting tombstone to the memory of
John Ridley, with a long rhyming epitaph (<i>see
<a href="#P149">facing page</a></i>).
</p>

<p>
Near the farm-house there is a very beautiful
avenue of old trees, beech, sycamore, ash and a
few Scotch firs.  A park-like meadow lies in front,
in which also are fine trees.  Range after range of
hills sweeps away to the south, the most distant
being Cross Fell.

<p><br></p>

<p>
The farm-house sounds kept coming up to me as
I sat on the hill painting, till at last everything
seemed to be asleep, even the farm-carts, which
were turned with their shafts up in a row in the
yard.
</p>

<p>
One evening, while I was sitting here, there was a
wonderful effect of rainbow-coloured clouds above
the sun.  I never saw anything like it before.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
These clouds were in rays, radiating upwards from
the sun as a centre, and they were just like wisps
of rainbow.  I can't describe them in any other
way.  They would form and then vanish, and form
again, and one spot immediately above the sun
always seemed more brilliant than all the rest.
</p>

<p>
The most modern version of "John Ridley"
showed me the chives which are supposed to date
back to Roman times, and which look like patches
of fine grey grass growing on the flat rocks on the
hillside below the mile-castle.  I should never have
found them without help.  I pulled some up, and
ate some of the tiny onion-like roots with my
bread-and-cheese lunch, just to see how they must
have tasted to the Roman sentries, who probably
ate them on the same spot when they were off
duty.
</p>

<p>
I had finished my sketch of Walltown, and it was
still in my painting-case when I was sitting working
late one evening on Sewingshields Crags.  The case
lay on the grass by my side.  When it was time to
go home, I strapped it up tight as usual.  Next
morning, when I looked at the sketch, there was a
large, round, dry yellow patch spread out over it!
A slug had walked into my painting-case, and in
strapping it up I had compressed it on the middle
of the picture.  I removed it carefully with a
pen-knife, and every scrap of colour came with it.  The
(probable) birthplace of the slug and the actual
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
scene of its death are two of the pictures which
are not included in this book.
</p>

<p>
I passed another Wall turret, with only the back
wall standing.  Just after that came a wide nick,
full of trees, alders and hawthorn, still dripping
from the recent rain.  The sweet smell of wet
young bracken greeted me all the time.  Before
the next nick there are some good bits of Wall,
seven or eight courses high.
</p>

<p>
So up and down went the Wall, and I with
it, clinging to the sides of the steepest nicks,
with unswerving loyalty to plan!  Sometimes its
northern face, overhanging the cliffs, presented an
unbroken surface of facing-stones for 5 or 6 feet;
sometimes there was but a mere mound.
</p>

<p>
Several of the nicks are little groves of trees.
Sheep were grazing everywhere, and rabbits still
abounded.  You might see them sitting up on the
Wall, the evening sun shining through their transparent
ears, with a (literally) blood-red glow; or
playing all sorts of pranks, apparently without fear
of intrusion.
</p>

<p>
The Wall finally runs straight to the edge of
Greenhead Quarry, where an iron fence is placed,
to keep the unwary (or too-faithful!) follower
of the Wall from tumbling over the cliff, as,
alas! the Wall has already done.
</p>

<p>
In the 1884 edition of Dr. Bruce's Handbook, there
is an interesting picture of a Wall turret standing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
on the very edge of the quarry.  Now it has gone;
it has simply been quarried away!
</p>

<p>
Not only was the rain over, but the sun was
sending long level golden rays over the tops of the
hills as I came to the quarry; and this was the
end of my Wall-walk for the day.  They were
standing at the door looking out for me when I
arrived at the house where I was to spend the night,
for I had been delayed by the storm.
</p>

<p>
I had felt indignant about that Wall turret, but
the next day I realized the necessity of forgiving
my enemies (in the shape of the Greenhead Quarry
Company), for I accepted an invitation to visit the
quarry before continuing my walk.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-152"></a>

<br>
THORNY DOORS GAP, WITH NINE NICKS OF THIRLWALL IN THE DISTANCE
</p>

<p>
It is a whinstone quarry, needless to say, for it is
busy cutting a large slice out of the basaltic ridge
on which the Wall has clung for so many miles.
I had previously been puzzled by the appearance of
the Cawfields Quarry, which is quite a landmark
for miles, making a rich yellow patch in the landscape.
If basalt is a dark blue-grey stone, how can
it make a yellow patch?  Now was my opportunity
to inquire.  The manager told me that although
whinstone is a dark blue-grey stone, yet it has a
yellow "skin" which forms on it under certain
conditions, as, for example, when the earth has
got in through cracks.  It is not a good building-stone,
apart from its colour and the difficulty of
dressing it, for capillary attraction draws the water
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
up through it very freely, so that it always seems
damp.  "The Romans were not able to work it,
as it can't be worked with wedges."
</p>

<p>
But somehow they <i>did</i> manage to cut deep
ditches through it at the top of Limestone Bank!
The great heaps of grey whin-dust (as it is called)
lying at the quarry were waiting, I was told, to
be made into blocks of artificial stone, being
subjected to great pressure, and thus forming an
artificial "conglomerate."
</p>

<p>
Before I left they gave me a practical illustration
of how the stone is brought down by blasting.
</p>

<p>
The Wall continues its course along the fields
opposite the quarry, forming a boundary wall
between them.  It is not in good condition (having
so recently tumbled over the cliff, a frivolous
person might say!), but its ditch is magnificent,
and was full of primroses, very late for the time
of year.
</p>

<p>
The Roman fort of MAGNA is just here, lying to
the south of both Wall and Vallum, which now
draw near together again, after their long separation.
No doubt this fort was originally built by Agricola,
long before the Wall was thought of.  A recent
discovery, given below, goes to prove that.
</p>

<p>
The site of the fort is to the west of the farm-house
of Carvoran.  I had no difficulty in tracing
the north rampart and the north ditch.  The
Stanegate came up to the fort, direct from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
Corstorpitum and Cilurnum; and another Roman road,
the Maiden Way, coming from the south, joined it
near the south-east angle.  The two roads are one
as far as Gilsland, where they separate, the former
aiming for Carlisle, and the latter for Birdoswald
and Bewcastle.
</p>

<p>
During the recent war, a very interesting bronze
vessel was found at Carvoran.  "Like a bucket,
only the top was where the bottom should be,"
was the graphic description given me locally, and
when I saw the vessel at Chesters Museum, I felt
how well it described it.  It was a measure for
corn, of the time of Domitian, the last emperor
under whom Agricola served, but the emperor's
name had been erased.  It therefore dates from
about 82 A.D., but it looks as if it had been made
yesterday.  The inscription is as clear and clean
as ever, except where it has been erased.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "IMP*/*/*/***** CAESARE<br>
  AVG · GERMANICO · XV · COS<br>
  EXACTVS · AD · S · XVIIS<br>
  HABET · P · XXXIIX"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It states that the vessel was measured and
tested to hold 17½ pints.  It really holds 20 pints.
</p>

<p>
No doubt the garrison at Magna received a
tribute of British corn in this measure.
</p>

<p>
It had long lain near the surface of the ground
at Carvoran, and the postman had kicked at it
many a time as he passed, thinking its rim was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
an old horseshoe.  At last a boy on the farm had
the curiosity to get a spade and dig it up.
</p>

<p>
The Wall-ditch runs along the fields, in splendid
condition, down to the valley of the Tipalt.  The
path lies along the north margin of the ditch.  It
led me over a fence at the bottom of the second
field into a beautiful little tree-filled glade, with
great swelling undulations in the surface of the
ground as it sloped rapidly down to the Tipalt.
At the bottom of this glade Thirlwall Castle came
suddenly into view, and I must confess I was
greatly struck by the beauty of its situation.
</p>

<p>
Thirlwall Castle (shown in the Frontispiece) dates
from the Middle Ages, and has figured largely in
border warfare.  It is built entirely of Roman
stones from the Wall.  It is now in a very ruined
state, all its eastern side having fallen into the
river Tipalt, above which it stands.  A little wooden
bridge crosses the stream just below the Castle,
and on this I sat to paint the picture.  Behind me
was Holmhead farm-house where there is a Roman
inscribed stone built upside-down into the back
premises, and where a dear old lady lives, the
patter of whose wooden clogs I could hear most
of the time as she went about her work.  She
used to visit me at intervals, and brought me
cushions to sit upon every day I was there.
</p>

<p>
I spent some happy times on the bridge, with
the life of the little hamlet going on around me:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
the sound of the dirling-pin on washing-day, the
beating of the bucket to summon the calves to be
fed, the laughter of the children as they played in
the stream, and the tap, tap of the hammer of the
old man at the cottage of Dooven Foot opposite.
He was busy making an erection by the side of
the stream to keep his fowls within bounds.
</p>

<p>
One evening I saw something white, high up
on the walls of the Castle, and went to see what it
was.  Two little girls, about nine years old, had
climbed adventurously up the walls.  They came
down and talked to me; told me how some day
"teacher" was going to take them to the source
of the Tipalt, where it rose in the hills.  We got
out my map and studied it.  We talked of the
lonely farms "out-by," with their picturesque
names, such as Far-Glow, and Hope-Alone, and
Seldom-Seen; and we pictured the solitary lights
shining out in the darkness, and the long, quiet
winter evenings they must spend, sometimes cut
off by snow from all communication with the outer
world; until at last a voice from below called, in
shocked tones, "Nora, don't ye know it's nine
o'clock?"  And so they hurried off to bed.
</p>

<p>
Holmhead is a typical Northumbrian farm-house,
built of Roman stones from the Wall.
</p>

<p>
I painted a picture of it in August, when
hay-making was going on.  To our southern eyes,
the method of carting hay in these parts seems
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
very slow and laborious.  The hay-wain is
dispensed with altogether.  Each hay-cock, or "pike,"
as they call them, is dragged separately, by means
of chains and a windlass, on to a flat cart with low
iron wheels, called a "bogie."  The trundling of
the iron wheels of the bogie on the stony roads
becomes a very familiar sound in the hay-season.
We timed the work as I sat painting on the hill,
and we found it took three men one and three-quarter
hours to bring in one pike and unload it,
though it came from only two fields away!  They
call the process "leading" hay.  The hilly character
of the ground, no doubt, accounts for the method
employed.
</p>

<p>
Continuing my walk, I crossed the little wooden
bridge over the Tipalt, and then bore round to the
left, past cottages, keeping now alongside the tawny
little river, a true tributary of the "tawny Tyne."
</p>

<p>
A heron flew low down across my path, and dived
between the low bushes on the river bank quite
close to me.  I peeped through them, and there
he was, standing majestically on a stone in the
middle of the river, fishing, looking very beautiful
with his blue-grey plumage and dull yellow legs.
</p>

<p>
Soon I came to the railway; the Wall is quite
lost in these low-lying fields, and one has to cross
the railway by the only path, almost on the site
of the Vallum.  Passing a row of new cottages,
called Thirlwall View, I came out into the road
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
leading to Gilsland, and now I could see the Vallum
in the fields across the road.  I entered the nearest
field-gate, and was now almost on the site of the
Wall again, as far as Wallend Farm.  Then the
Wall-ditch appeared again, very conspicuous indeed,
of great size and interest.  I pursued it through
grassy meadows, which seemed to be all ditch
and rampart, and over stone walls, till I came to
a thick group of trees beside a stream.  Here were
the farm-houses of Chapel House and Foul Town.
A troop of young black cattle saw in me a hope
of getting through the farm-gate, and followed me
closely, even licking my hands as I opened the
gate!  But they did not get through.  I could
not find the "Hadrian" stone at Chapel House
which Dr. Bruce refers to, and they could tell me
nothing of it at the farm; but I understand it has
been taken to the Black Gate Museum, Newcastle.
I crossed a bridge over the stream and continued
westward, Orchard House, Gilsland and the Shaws
Hotel coming into view on the green slopes on
the right.
</p>

<p>
At the Red House, Gap, a pet lamb with a
garland round its neck, made overtures to me.  At
the White House, I turned into the farm-yard,
and went to examine the centurial stone mentioned
by Dr. Bruce.  It was thickly whitewashed over,
and quite illegible.  I had seen it so on a previous
visit, and had begged to be allowed to remove
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
the whitewash, much to the amusement of the
farmer's wife.  However, she humoured me, and
brought me a bowl of warm water and a sponge.
It was all the kinder of her, because it was Gilsland
show-day, a great occasion, and she was busy
sending off the men and the animals in all their
bravery, with coats being brushed, and manes
and tails properly combed out&mdash;all in the farm-yard.
</p>

<p>
I left the stone looking beautifully clear, though
it made what the farmer probably thought was an
ugly dark patch in the white wall; but I begged
them to keep it so when next the wall was
whitewashed.
</p>

<p>
So I was disappointed to find they had forgotten.
No wonder Dr. Bruce himself failed at first to find
it on his last visit; that is what I was told had
happened.
</p>

<p>
After leaving White House, I found the Wallditch
again magnificent between Gap and Gilsland
Station, and the mounds of the Vallum running on
a higher level than the Wall, for a wonder.
</p>

<p>
The line of the Wall crosses a side-road to the
south of Gilsland Station, and continues through
fields to the Poltross Burn, which is the boundary
between Northumberland and Cumberland.  I
followed it, but coming to a stone wall, with piggeries
and bee-hives set up close against it, blocking my
path, I had to climb the wooden fence on to the
railway embankment, and so came without difficulty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
to the edge of the burn, just where the Wall must
have crossed it.
</p>

<p>
There is a curious stratification of the rocks here;
sloping ledges, from 4 to 6 feet high, make a series
of great natural steps down.  There must be a drop
of some 20 feet from the bed of the stream, where
the Wall crossed it to the point where the railway
arch crosses it, only a few yards away.
</p>

<p>
Farther to the south, the banks of the stream
are lined with Roman stones, where the Vallum
crossed it; also the sides of the Vallum-ditch.  This
is not found elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Crossing the burn, I climbed the steep bank on
the opposite side, which is planted thick with trees,
and came out just at the site of the mile-castle
which is known as Poltross Burn mile-castle.  It
was evidently placed here to guard the passage of
the stream.  It was excavated by the late
Mr. J. P. Gibson and Mr. F. G. Simpson in 1910, but has
been covered up again, and only a cairn of stones
between the stream and the railway-line marks its
situation.  Locally, it was known as "The King's
Stables" by the country people.  The discovery in
this mile-castle of a flight of stairs leading up to the
rampart-walk is especially valuable, because from
them a calculation of its height could be made.
It was found to be 12 feet above the first-period
floor, thus confirming previous calculations of its
probable height.  There was also a complete
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
arrangement of inner buildings with walls 2 feet
thick.
</p>

<p>
The Wall can be seen from here running through
the Vicarage garden, the other side of the railway.
</p>

<p>
I crossed the line opposite the Vicarage, and
then cut across the fields, past the schools, into
the road.
</p>

<p>
Calling at the Vicarage, I was most kindly
received by the Vicar, who is always willing to welcome
pilgrims of the Wall.  He showed me the fine piece
of Wall in his garden, the most striking feature of
which is the unusually wide foundation which has
been laid bare.  There were also two Roman altars,
which had long formed part of the altar-steps at
the little Saxon Church of Over Denton, 2 miles
away; and some centurial stones, ballista balls
and mill-stones.  He pointed out where the Vallum
also ran through his garden, for Vallum and Wall
are very near together here.
</p>

<p>
At Over Denton Church the original chancel arch
is a Roman gateway brought from Amboglanna,
and the font is formed from the capital of a Roman
pillar.
</p>

<p>
Close by Gilsland Vicarage lives Miss Ewart,
of Raise House, a favourite resort of archæologists,
and students of the Wall, and to her I appealed for
lunch.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
GILSLAND TO LANERCOST
</h3>

<p>
After lunching at Gilsland, I started off
again at three o'clock, intending to make
only a short distance that day, and to
sleep at the Lanercost Temperance Hotel.  I
picked up the line of the Wall where I had dropped
it&mdash;at the Vicarage.  Keeping westward along the
road, I turned into a field-path on the right, just
past a new cottage known as "Roman Wall Villa,"
behind which, remains of the Wall are to be seen.
This path leads through meadows right along the
line of the Wall, with the lovely little river Irthing
twisting its way below on the right, half-hidden by
the trees which overhang it.
</p>

<p>
Fragments of the core of the Wall are seen at
intervals, and presently the path runs right along
the bottom of the deep Wall-ditch.  Great trees
grow on the top of its northern mound.  So we
come to Willowford farm-house, where for the
moment all traces of the Wall disappear, no doubt
because its stones were used to build the house.
</p>

<p>
I descended the steep little grassy hill on which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
the house stands, and crept through the barbed-wire
fence at the bottom into a flat meadow on
a level with the river.  There, in the hedge, were
Wall-stones in plenty, and again the path lay in the
ditch, though it had been very nearly levelled,
probably by the plough.  The river Irthing was
still on the right, curving round to meet the line of
the Wall.  Just before they meet, the Wall
disappears again, and the low bank of the river is
covered with undergrowth.  The opposite bank is
very high and precipitous, thickly clothed with
trees and bushes; but on its summit can be seen
clinging a precious bit of the Wall, seven courses high.
</p>

<p>
Keeping to my resolve of following the Wall
through thick and thin, I took off my shoes and
stockings, and crossed the river, after searching in
vain for any signs of how the Wall had crossed it.
Where it had crossed it I could guess, from the
overhanging piece of Wall in front, and the line
along which I had come.
</p>

<p>
I am told by those who have the right to express
an opinion that there certainly is a bridge buried
here, on the east bank, and that it's simply "asking"
to be excavated!
</p>

<p>
The river was fairly low, so I was able to cross
dry-footed, jumping from stone to stone, with only
one hazardous jump in the middle, where the
current of the stream flows deepest.  I was now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
beneath the cliffs which Jenkinson in his <i>Guide</i>
describes as "now quite precipitous and impossible
to ascend."  But it was not impossible at all,
though difficult.  The thick growth of trees and
bushes was both a hindrance and a help, for, though
it barred my way, it gave more foothold on the
steep bank.
</p>

<p>
At last I came out on the top, close to the fine
bit of Wall still standing, and could examine it at
leisure.  It is making straight for Birdoswald
farm-house, now not far away, and the eye can follow
it along the boundary hedge between cornfields and
pasture-land.
</p>

<p>
Close by, on the high bank of the Irthing, are
traces of the Harrow's Scar mile-castle, placed here
to guard the passage of the stream.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
THE WALL OVERHANGING THE IRTHING.
</p>

<p>
This bank of the Irthing, where the Wall still
clings at the top, was a perfectly bare, sandy bank
in 1848, without trees or undergrowth, as shown in
H. B. Richardson's drawing in Newcastle.  In
1801, when Hutton climbed it, he speaks of
"brambles," so it would almost look as if there
had been a landslip on this bank between 1801
and 1848.  Now it is covered very thickly with
vegetation, especially low down near the river.
</p>

<br>
THE WALL OVERHANGING THE IRTHING
</p>

<p>
When I was making this sketch, I walked one day
to the bank of the river, a little below the Wall,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
and there I suddenly saw the figure of a girl appear
in a tree overhanging the water on the other side.
I looked again, and I saw she was seated in a little
wooden chair suspended from a wire, and was
pulling herself across by another wire, both of which
crossed from side to side.  I waited for her to land,
and then I asked: "Do you think I might use
that?"  She said: "It belongs to Underheugh,
that farm down there, but I dare say you might."
</p>

<p>
I promptly went to Underheugh and asked
permission.  The farmer's wife said: "Oh ay, ye may
if ye like, but ye'd do better by plodgin'."
</p>

<p>
"What <i>is</i> 'plodging'?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "Oh, it's just takin' off yer shoes
and stockin's and goin' throo on yer feet."
</p>

<p>
"I have done that already; so I'd rather cross
by the wire," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, ye may, so long as ye leave the ropes
right."
</p>

<p>
So when it was time to go home, I ventured into
the chair and laid hold of the wire rope, and pulled.
I only had one hand, as the other clutched my
sketching-things, so it was rather hard work.  It was
literally uphill work after I got to the middle, though
to start with it was downhill, and the thing almost
went of itself.  It felt funny to be suspended
from a rope over the middle of the Irthing, in this
very primitive "chair."
</p>

<p>
I asked at Underheugh what they called the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
arrangement, but they could not say.  Then I
inquired at Birdoswald.  "Oh, you mean a sort
of an aeroplane?"
</p>

<p>
That was the nearest I could get!  And "a sort
of an aeroplane" it will always be to me!  I used
it several times after that.
</p>

<p>
A short walk from the overhanging Wall brought
me to AMBOGLANNA, at Birdoswald.  This is the
largest of all the forts, occupying 5½ acres as against
the 5¼ of Cilurnum.  Like Cilurnum it has six
gateways, an extra and smaller gateway to east
and west, lying to the south of the main eastern
and western gateways.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Cilurnum, but like Borcovicium and Æsica,
its northern wall is joined, at its rounded corners,
by the Great Wall.  The circumscribing ditch of the
fort has been found underneath the Great Wall, as at
Æsica, showing that the fort is earlier than the Wall.
</p>

<p>
An older fort is shown to have stood here, because
the ditch which surrounded it has been traced,
cutting across the present fort to the north portal
of the eastern gateway, and this ditch can be traced
again in one or two places westward.
</p>

<p>
The north gate of the original fort would be about
on the site of the <i>Principia</i> of the present one.
The excavations conducted by Professor Haverfield
and Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Hodgson, between 1895
and 1900, prove that the fort was extended north
and south at the same time, northwards over the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
ditch of the older fort, and southwards on to the
Vallum.  The south-west angle tower is where the
north mound of the Vallum ought to be.  The
Vallum curves round the original fort, and makes
a straight course east.  To the west it has been
entirely destroyed by a landslip.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
Fig. 14.&mdash;Comparative Plans of Gateways. (After John Ward.) Scale: 30 feet to 1 inch.
</p>

<p>
It is a very steep fall to the Irthing on the south
of the fort.  Possibly the river has changed its
course 100 yards since Roman times.  Twenty
years ago its course was changed 60 yards in a few
hours at Underheugh (just under these cliffs to the
east) by a flood.
</p>

<p>
The granary, just in front of the farm-house, has
air-passages underneath, to keep the corn both
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
dry and cool, as at Corstopitum.  The gateways
have as usual been built up in the later periods of
the Roman occupation, and the floors raised.  The
north portal of the large eastern gateway has been
blocked, and the west portal of the southern
gateway.  Both of these gateways are in good
preservation, especially the eastern one, where one
of the imposts is specially noticeable.
</p>

<p>
Inscriptions found at Birdoswald confirm the
<i>Notitia</i> statement that the first cohort of the Dacians,
styled the Ælian, was quartered here.
</p>

<p>
The picture facing this page represents the view
from Amboglanna referred to by the late Lord
Carlisle, in his <i>Diary in Turkish and Greek Waters</i>.
He says:
</p>

<p>
"Strikingly, and to any one who has coasted
the uniform shore of the Hellespont, and crossed
the tame low plain of the Troad, unexpectedly
lovely is this site of Troy, if Troy it was.  I could
give any Cumberland borderer the best notion of
it, by telling him that it wonderfully resembles
the view from the point just outside the Roman
camp at Birdoswald: both have that series of
steep conical hills, with rock enough for wildness,
and verdure enough for softness; both have that
bright trail of a river creeping in and out with the
most continuous indentations: the Simois has, in
summer at least, more silvery shades of sand."

<br>
VIEW FROM THE FORT OF AMBOGLANNA, LOOKING SOUTH, ACROSS THE IRTHING
</p>

<p>
While busy over this book, I came across a photograph
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
of the Greek view at a friend's house, and
though I recognized the resemblance, I felt that
Cumberland could well hold its own with Greece.
</p>

<p>
From Amboglanna the Wall and the road follow
the same line as far as the village of Banks.  For
500 yards west of Birdoswald, the Wall is the south
boundary of the road.  From that point onwards
to Banks the Wall is the foundation of the road.
This was ascertained by excavations made by the
late Mr. J. P. Gibson and Mr. F. G. Simpson, who
found that two Wall turrets (known as High House
and Apple-tree turrets) come within the
road-boundary, as also does a quarter of the mile-castle
known as High House mile-castle.  In these turrets
and the mile-castle four floors were traceable, the
dates of which are roughly as follows, beginning
with the highest:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  1. About 300 A.D.<br>
  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 210 A.D.  under Severus.<br>
  3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 158 A.D.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antoninus Pius.<br>
  4. 120-125 A.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadrian.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Vallum on the left and the Wall-ditch on
the right call for notice all along this stretch of road;
and here also is something unique, the turf-wall,
running to meet the Great Wall at Wallbowers.
As has been mentioned, it starts from near Harrow's
Scar mile-castle, and is like the string of a bow,
the Great Wall being the bow.
</p>

<p>
On the "Pilgrimage" in September 1920, sections
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
of the turf-wall were cut to show the black and
white lines marking the limits of the turves.  The
vegetable-matter turns black, and bleaches the
soil that comes next to it.
</p>

<p>
At Coome Crag I turned off to the left to see the
Roman quarrymen's marks.  I knocked at the
lodge-door to ask for a guide, but only a dog replied,
and he was chained.  So I followed the path, which
runs through a beautiful wood, sloping down towards
the Irthing; and I had no difficulty in finding the
quarry, and the Roman names, cut rather near the
bottom of a large mass of rock with a flat
wall-like surface.  How surprised "SECVRVS" and
"IVSTVS" and "MATHRIANVS" would have
been if they had been told that thousands would
follow the path to the quarry, like pilgrims to a
shrine, just to see the names they had cut in an
idle moment during their lunch-hour!  It may be
that they were employed by Severus in repairing
the Wall, for there is another inscription, "FAVST
ET RVF COS," and Dr. Bruce tells us that Faustinus
and Rufus were Consuls in 210 A.D., just when
Severus was in Britain.
</p>

<p>
Near Leahill farm-house, on the right of the road,
the Wall-ditch is in excellent condition.
</p>

<p>
It had been very hot and close in the Coome Crag
woods, but now there was a cool exhilarating breeze.
On the left the Lake-mountains had come clearly
into view, Helvellyn, Blencathra and snow-capped
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
Skiddaw.  I passed a number of cottages which had
been allowed to fall into disrepair and would soon
disappear altogether.
</p>

<p>
In the village of Banks, or Banks Hill, I saw an
Inn, called "The Traveller's Rest," and thought of
tea, but, alas! there was no one at home.  The
Banks Burn crosses under the road at the foot of a
little hill beyond the Inn, and in a field this side of
the burn, there can be seen a great piece of the
Wall with bushes growing out of it.  Just after
crossing the burn, the road ceases to run east
and west, and instead cuts the line of the Wall
at right-angles.  I stood in the turn doubtfully,
wondering how I could still continue to follow the
Wall, as a private garden evidently lay beyond the
hedge which faced me.  Two children, and a man
carrying a suit-case, were also waiting in the
road&mdash;waiting, it appeared, for a motor-car, just coming
into sight.  Fortunately for me, this was the owner
of the garden, with his two grandchildren, and he
kindly sent one of them to ask if I was looking for
the Roman Wall.  Of course I said, "Yes";
and then he shouted: "Wait till I have packed the
children into the car, and I'll take you to see
it."  So I waited, and then followed him along a
side-road into the garden of Hare Hill, where suddenly,
round a corner, we came full on a splendid piece of
Wall.  This is the piece of which Hutton says:
"I viewed this relic with admiration.  I saw no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
part higher."  When he saw it, the facing-stones were
all gone, but now fifteen courses have been
restored on the north side by Lord Carlisle's architect.
It stands 9 feet 10 inches high.
</p>

<p>
As we came away, I remembered there should be
a mile-castle close to this piece of Wall, and I
wanted to turn back to look for it.  My guide was
quite excited about it; he had no idea there was a
<i>Castle</i> at Hare Hill!  But we would ask his wife
about it first.  So we went to the house, and as we
entered, he called: "Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash;, here's a lady to
see you."  I said: "Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; has kindly been
showing me the Roman Wall in your garden."  He
turned sharply on me and said: "Now how on earth
did you know my name?"  I explained that it had
not required a wizard to guess it, under the
circumstances!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash; could throw no light on the subject
of the mile-castle, and her husband continued to
murmur: "To think I should have had this place
twenty years without knowing there was a castle
in the garden!"  I again suggested going back
to the Wall to look for it; but no! he said we would
go and ask some neighbours who lived in a long, low,
whitewashed thatched cottage close by, and who
"ought to know, for they have lived there over four
hundred years."
</p>

<p>
I found this a very interesting visit.  The family
consisted of two brothers and a sister, all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
unmarried.  They were the last remaining members
of the Burtholme family, who have occupied this
cottage since the sixteenth century.  It had been
the village smithy, and their father had been the
last of a series of "Thomas Burtholmes, blacksmiths,"
who figure largely in the parish register.
The cottage was full of tokens of antiquity.  On
the old dresser there was the most beautiful and
complete set of pewter plates that I have ever seen,
each plate marked "T. B.," and I understood that
Lady Carlisle had more than once borrowed them
for exhibition at Naworth Castle on some special
occasion.
</p>

<p>
But as for the Roman mile-castle, they also had
never heard of it; so we went back to the Wall,
and there, quite clearly discernible, it lay, between
the line of the Wall and the Hare Hill cottage; and
though nothing but grassy mounds could be seen,
still it was something to have a "castle" of any sort
in one's garden, so the proud owner thought!
He told me he was a Tynemouth man, and had come
to stay at Lanercost Temperance Hotel many years
ago, when paralyzed after a bad smash-up in a
railway accident; and there, in the country peace
and quiet, he had learned to walk again.  No
wonder that he loved the neighbourhood, and had
been glad to secure this cottage for his permanent
use.
</p>

<p>
Lanercost Temperance Hotel was my objective
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
that evening, and he offered to show me the shortest
way, continuing the line of the Wall from his garden.
We went through a farm-yard and along the fields,
seeing bits of the Wall in the hedge at frequent
intervals, and the ditch in the next fields to the
north.  Below, on the left, ran the Vallum,
sometimes clearly seen, and sometimes disappearing
in the Priory Woods.
</p>

<p>
Up Craggle Hill the Wall-ditch is very strongly
marked, and in one place is full of water.
</p>

<p>
There is a lovely view from this hill, stretching
right over Carlisle to the Solway, and to Scotland,
and the Lake-mountains.
</p>

<p>
At Hayton-gate Farm we left the Wall and turned
down southwards, crossing the Vallum, and soon
coming into the lane which leads to Lanercost
Priory.
</p>

<p>
The Vicar of Lanercost was standing outside
the ancient gateway of the Priory; the evening
service was just over, and he was apparently taking
leave of the last departing member of his
congregation.  My guide performed a rough-and-ready
introduction as we drew near, shouting: "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
here's a pilgrim to see you who has walked from
Wallsend."  The Vicar came forward and shook
hands, and then kindly promised, at my request,
to let me have the keys of the Priory at nine o'clock
next morning, instead of the usual hour of ten.  The
beauty of the ruins in their warm red stone struck
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
me very forcibly as I saw them now for the first
time in the evening light.
</p>

<p>
I continued my way to the Lanercost Hotel,
over the picturesque stone bridge (dated 1723)
which here crosses our now familiar friend, the
Irthing.  "The last departing member of the
congregation" was just mounting his bicycle, but
he kindly stopped to point out to me the remains
of an ancient bridge on the north side of the river,
possibly a Roman bridge, the position of which
indicates that the river has changed its course.
He then asked if I wanted to see Naworth Castle
the next day.  It was not really in my plan, for I
had been told it was not open to visitors till two
o'clock, and that would have delayed me too long,
and I said so.  I did not know I was speaking to
Lord Carlisle's agent, but now he gave me his name,
and courteously offered to show me the castle in the
morning, after my visit to the Priory.  Such an
opportunity was not to be missed, so I thankfully
accepted.
</p>

<p>
It was a blow for the moment when I reached
the Hotel to find that they could not take me in.
Week-end visitors occupied all their bedrooms, and
the "all" was probably not many.  However, the
proprietress told me there were houses along the
road to Brampton where I might get taken in.  I
was sorry not to stop at Lanercost, for the Inn is
in a beautiful spot, with the woods of Naworth Park
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
just opposite, and the Irthing flowing past almost
at its doors.  Besides, every step I took now would
be one step farther from the Wall, and would add
to my journey on the following day.  But there
was no help for it, so I pushed on up the steep hill
towards Brampton, with Naworth Park on my left,
and passing on the right Boothby, where the old
Dowager Lady Carlisle had made her home.
</p>

<p>
I called at several cottages, but no one could
give me a bed.  It was now beginning to get dark,
and I was thinking it would soon be too late to call
at another house, when I came to one which looked
more promising.  In answer to my knock, an old
man appeared with a long white beard, and a face
which would have done credit to an apostle.  When
I told him what I wanted, he looked doubtful, but
asked me to come in.  I followed him along the
passage, through the kitchen, where a cheerful
log-fire was burning, and through the garden to a
cow-byre at the back of the house.  There, in spite
of my desire to find a haven, I forgot everything
else in looking at the picture before me.  A young
woman was milking the cow, and a picturesque
white-haired woman held the lantern for her.  The
face of the younger woman, seen in the lantern-light,
looked really beautiful.  A small boy and a collie
dog made up the picture.  There was something
in the lighting and the grouping&mdash;in the whole
scene&mdash;which enthralled me.  I said to myself:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
"It is worth anything to have seen that," and it
seemed hardly necessary to ask if they could take
me in.  I knew quite well that I had come to the
right house.  And so I had!  They made no
difficulty about the lateness of the hour, about the
bed not being made up, nor any details of that kind.
They said I looked tired, and that was enough for
them.  And indeed I was hungry, for I had had
nothing since lunch at Gilsland, and had been
walking all the time.  So I did full justice, first to
the new-laid eggs and "berry-cake," and then to
the roomy feather-bed, where I slept till daybreak.
</p>

<p>
Next morning my kind hostesses filled the
crannies of my haversack with lunch, and I set out
to visit Lanercost Priory.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>LANERCOST TO BLEATARN
</h3>

<p>
Lanercost Priory is built almost entirely
of Roman stones.  Dr. Bruce was of
opinion that there must have been a
fort on the site, and that, as the river Irthing was
crossed by a Roman bridge close by, it might have
been thought necessary to guard the passage.
However, recent opinion is entirely against this
view.
</p>

<p>
The nave of the Priory church is used as the
parish church; the choir and transepts are roofless.
It must have been very beautiful when the building
was complete, though indeed the ruins are beautiful
as they are.
</p>

<p>
In the crypt are Roman altars, and a sculptured
stone representing Jupiter and Hercules.  One of
the altars is dedicated by the hunters of Banna to
the holy god Silvanus, and suggests how these
Roman officers may have spent their leisure.  The
situation of "Banna" has not been identified.
</p>

<p>
From Lanercost I visited Naworth Castle, but,
interesting and beautiful as it is, it hardly can find
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
a place in the limits of this book.  Now if only
it could present a claim to be built of Roman
stones&mdash;&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
From Naworth I made straight for Hayton-gate,
on the Wall, to pick up the thread at the right
place.  The farmer's wife came out and followed
me, as I turned westward along the Wall.  I
looked back after a little.  "Ye'll be thinking I'm
following ye," she cried.  "It's they hens; they're
awfu' for laying away."  And with each dive into
the nettles, she brought out an egg.
</p>

<p>
The next farm is Randelands.  Here the ground
begins to slope down towards Burtholme Beck,
and the village of Burtholme is away on the left.
A mile-castle appears, covered more thickly with
buttercups and daisies than the rest of the field.
To the north is Walton Wood, which is so dense
that the country people say that a stranger placed
there could never find his way out.
</p>

<p>
Before crossing the road which leads to the right
to Garthside Farm, I saw several strips of Wall in
the hedge, the core including great blocks of red
sandstone, such as is used in the building of
Lanercost Priory.  Oaks, hawthorns and alders were
growing on the top, while below was a perfect
flower-garden&mdash;primroses, bluebells, campion,
speedwell, garlic and the greater stitchwort.
</p>

<p>
From the Garthside road, the Wall-ditch formed
the boundary between a field of wheat and a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
hay-field, so I was able to follow it till I came out into
another lane at Howgill.  Here in the farmyard I
began to search for the inscribed stone, mentioned
by Dr. Bruce as being in the wall of an outhouse.
Two men were driving out a flock of sheep, and in
answer to my "Good day," one of them said: "I
know what ye're looking for; wait a bit and I'll
show ye."  He led me through the farm-yard, and
through a wicket-gate into a garden; and there,
lying on the ground, overgrown with moss, and
almost buried in ground-elder, was the stone.  It
seemed to me that it was much safer when it was
built into the outhouse.  My guide said it was a
long time since he had shown it to anybody, and
I could well believe it.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bruce says of it: "It seems to record the
achievements of a British tribe, the Catuvellauni.
Tacitus tells us that Agricola took Southern Britons
with him to the battle of Mons Graupius; Hadrian
and Severus may have been similarly accompanied
in their expeditions."
</p>

<p>
From Howgill I had to turn north along the lane
a little way in order to strike the Wall again.
</p>

<p>
I soon came to Low Wall, the next farm, and
now I began to have visions of a glass of milk with
my lunch.  It was very quiet in the farm-yard, and
I guessed the household must be at dinner, and so
it proved.
</p>

<p>
The door on which I knocked opened straight
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
into the living-room, and remains of soup and
potatoes were on the table, from which men and
women were just rising.
</p>

<p>
Miss B&mdash;&mdash;, the daughter, who answered my
knock, insisted on taking me into the parlour to eat
my lunch, and when she had fetched some milk,
she sat and talked to me.  She told me of their
experiences during the war, how they had had
refugee Belgians close to them, at Howgill&mdash;relays
of Belgians, some quite nice, and others "a rough
lot."  These last used to catch and eat the
blackbirds, besides sucking their eggs, and had made
quite a stir in this quiet neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
My lunch finished, she took me back to the
living-room, and introduced me to her mother, a
dear old lady of ninety-one.  When I told her I was
walking to Bowness, she at once began to recall a
visit she had paid eighty years ago, when she had
gone to stay at Peartree House, Bowness, on account
of her health.  She made the journey by canal,
from Carlisle to Port Carlisle, and had evidently
enjoyed the whole experience.  This canal was
only open from 1823 to 1854.
</p>

<p>
When I got up to go, Miss B&mdash;&mdash; popped on her
sunbonnet and came with me.  She showed me
where a mile-castle had been excavated, in 1900, in
one of their fields, north of the house.
</p>

<p>
In the field north of Dovecote, I thought I saw
traces of a turret, but I could not be sure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
</p>

<p>
The core of the Wall is now clearly to be seen,
all the way to the King Water, but both Wall and
ditch disappeared in a field of young corn which
slopes down to the water's edge.
</p>

<p>
The King Water flows from north to south at this
point, right across the line of the Wall.  As is so
often the case with northern rivers, it has a very
steep bank on one side, while the ground slopes
gently down on the other.  There is nothing to
show how the Wall was carried across this stream,
but I found it very easily fordable, by stepping-stones
just where the Wall must have been.  On
this May day, the steep western bank was a riot
of colour.  The colour of the earth of the bank is
red, almost pink, from the red sandstone; on it
was growing a perfect blaze of yellow broom.  With
a deep blue sky overhead, and the fresh green of the
grass and trees, the whole colour-scheme was very
much inclined to be garish&mdash;not to say "Futurist"&mdash;in
character!
</p>

<p>
I crossed the stream, and climbed the red bank,
threading my way between the bushes of broom,
from which the bees were raising a continuous
drone.  It was easy to pick up the Wall again on
the top of the cliff; a great ash was growing just
on the Wall, at the cliff's edge.  On the right at this
point a little stream runs into the King Water,
forming a natural Wall-ditch.  Broom and blue-bells
made a harmony of blue and gold in its narrow gorge.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
</p>

<p>
I found it better now to descend into the road,
which runs on the left close by, keeping parallel to
the Wall.  It soon brought me into the village of
Walton (Wall-town), a pretty village, with delightful
views of the valley of the Irthing and of the
Lake-mountains.
</p>

<p>
I followed the road past the Black Bull Inn,
which stands on the exact site of the Wall; and
then, to keep the trail, I had to turn off on the
right, along a lane which led to a field-path to
Sandysike farm-house.
</p>

<p>
Here, in the hedge on my left, were Wall-stones
once more.
</p>

<p>
The farm-buildings at Sandysike are very
ancient-looking and picturesque.  There is a hexagonal
cart-shed built of stone, with a tiled roof, and an
old barn, of brick, with strikingly lofty
round-headed arches; but I did not see the Roman
sculptured stones of which it boasts.
</p>

<p>
The track of the Wall can be followed down to
the edge of the Cam Beck, the ditch being our guide;
but here for the first time I deliberately abandoned
it!  I could not cross the Cam Beck where the Wall
had crossed it without getting very wet and dirty,
and part of my compact with myself was to keep
clean and dry, if possible.  The river cuts its way
at this point very deeply through the red sandstone.
Sheer red banks stand out of the water.  A very
high weir across the stream would have made
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
crossing easier, but a large tree-trunk had fallen
over it, and blocked the way.  Already grass and
plants were growing out of its slippery black sides.
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly I turned back, and took the path
to Castlesteads, the house of Mrs. Johnson, whose
garden is on the site of a Roman fort.  The path
brought me through woodland and shrubbery to a
house which proved to be the head gardener's.
The barking of a dog produced the gardener, who
took me to the lawn which represents the centre of
the fort.  A little summer-house at the edge of the
lawn serves as protection to a number of Roman
altars, and other sculptures, found within the fort.
</p>

<p>
They were all in the red sandstone of the neighbourhood,
some covered with a bright greenish-yellow
lichen.  The largest altar was dedicated to
Jupiter by the second cohort of the Tungrians.
</p>

<p>
The site of this fort lies between the Wall and
the Vallum, which latter curves to the south to
avoid it.  This was proved by excavations made
by Professor Haverfield and Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Hodgson
in 1902.  They traced accurately the
position of the Vallum in this section of the
fortifications for a distance of about 4 miles, from
Garthside to the south of Cumrenton&mdash;a work needing
endless patience.  On one occasion many trenches
had been dug and measurements taken, but Mr. Hodgson
had not time to plot it all out till the end
of the season.  When he did so, all the points where
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
the Vallum had been struck fell into one straight
line!
</p>

<p>
The walls and gateways of this fort appear to
have been standing until 1791, when the ground
changed hands, and the house of Castlesteads was
built.  Then the standing masonry was removed,
and the whole site levelled.
</p>

<p>
The gardener showed me the way from the back
of the summer-house, through woods that sloped
down to the Cam Beck, to a little bridge that crossed
the stream and led me out of the grounds.  And so
I came to Cambeck Hill Farm, which lies on the
line of the Wall.
</p>

<p>
But I was not satisfied till I had traced the Wall
back eastward through the fields to the edge of the
Cam Beck opposite the place where I had failed to
cross.  The view from this side is most striking,
with the red sandstone walls, and the steep steps
of the weir.  I was very glad I had not missed it.
A Roman altar from Castlesteads was built into
this weir for a time, but some one put in a plea for
it, and it was rescued.
</p>

<p>
The field gate which leads to the river is in the
Wall-ditch, which at this point is cut deep out of
the sandstone.
</p>

<p>
I tried to make the crossing from this side, but
it was impossible.  It made it no easier that the
wet sandstone was <i>soft</i>, as well as slippery, and
crumbled away under one's feet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
</p>

<p>
The next farm-house to Cambeck Hill is Beck,
which is partly built of Roman stones.  A wooden
foot-bridge over a beck is crossed just before the
farm is reached.  Beyond Beck is Headswood,
which stands high up on a grassy knoll.  The
Wall-ditch and the Vallum-ditch can be clearly seen
from Beck, running up this grassy knoll, one to
the right, and the other to the left, of the farm
and farm-buildings of Headswood.  Two or three
minutes' walk and a short climb brought me into
the farm-yard, where a part of the Wall-ditch is
used as a duck-pond.
</p>

<p>
Just in front of the farm-buildings it has been
filled up level with the ground, for the convenience
of traffic.
</p>

<p>
A short distance beyond Headswood I found
the Wall itself again with me.
</p>

<p>
The village of Newtown of Irthington soon came
into sight.  It has a village green with a large pond.
Its white-washed cottages stand on three sides of
this green, on which battalions of ducks and geese
were pluming themselves.
</p>

<p>
For the short distance between Newtown and
White Flat, the "pilgrim of the Wall" must leave
the fields and follow the road towards Irthington.
On the left of the road, traces of a mile-castle are
visible.
</p>

<p>
Beyond White Flat the fields are ploughed, but
the ditch could be faintly discerned.  The path
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
now ran through a meadow gay with wild flowers,
but there was more food for the botanist than for
the antiquarian.  My thoughts were beginning to
turn to another kind of food, for it was after five
o'clock, and it seemed a long time since I was at
Low Wall, though actually it was only three miles
as the crow flies.
</p>

<p>
I saw a substantial farm-house on my right, so I
turned off in hopes of getting at least some milk.
My hopes were super-abundantly realized.  The
farmer and his wife were on the point of sitting down
to tea themselves, having just driven back from
Carlisle, and with true northern hospitality they
invited me to share their meal.  I shall not soon
forget that visit, and the kindness shown to a
pilgrim.
</p>

<p>
They showed me a centurial stone built into the
wall of their house just above the door, and
protected by the wooden porch.  Beside it are two
other Roman stones with very clear broaching.
They told me they had shown them to only one
other visitor since they came to live there eight
years ago.
</p>

<p>
When I left, the farmer kindly insisted on coming
with me as far as the Wall, to make sure I did not
miss my way.  He brought me to the "long strip
of the Wall in an encouraging state" mentioned
by Dr. Bruce.  It is planted with oaks&mdash;quite large
trees; and its ditch at this point is very impressive.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is in this neighbourhood that the Wall and
the Vallum approach each other within 35 yards.
</p>

<p>
At Old Wall, the next farm, many Roman stones
are seen in the buildings, and there are great piles
of them lying in the roadway, amongst them what
looks like a lintel.  The Wall-ditch is clearly seen
between the road and the house.
</p>

<p>
It came on to rain as I approached Old Wall,
but, hoping that it would not be much, I pushed
on.  I thought I could get to Wallhead and then
strike down into the Carlisle Road.
</p>

<p>
A drove-road runs along the site of the Wall, a
grassy lane with high hedges, so I could follow this;
but before I reached Bleatarn the rain came down
in such torrents that I was compelled to leave the
Wall and get down into the main road as quickly
as possible.  So I turned south until I saw ahead
of me the gleam of the rain on a macadamized
surface.  The rain was still streaming down, "like
knitting-needles," as some one has said, and there
seemed to be no one about.  At High Crosby I
inquired for an Inn, and was told there was one at
Low Crosby.  By this time I was so wet I should
have been glad to get in anywhere, but the
landlady of the Stag at Low Crosby was quite
uncompromising.  "We don't give beds," said she.  I
asked for supper.  No, she could not give supper
either.  "Might I come in and write a letter?"  "Ay,
ye can do that."  So I threaded my way
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
amongst the men who were sitting round little
tables, with their pipes and beer, in the only room
of the Inn, conscious that I was leaving a wet
trail in the sawdust on the floor; and I found a
little table in a corner and wrote my letter.  Then
I called the landlady, and, giving her a shilling, I
asked if she could have my letter delivered at a
house in the neighbourhood early the next day.
She took the shilling and held it up between her
finger and thumb.  "Do I deliver this with the
letter?" said she.
</p>

<p>
"No; that's for yerself," came in a chorus from
the men sitting round, who had been taking more
interest than I knew!
</p>

<p>
Just then there was a little whispering between
the landlady and a man who had just arrived.
She came forward.  "This gentleman says that he
and his wife will be pleased to take you into Carlisle
in their car, if you would like."  Would I like?
Could there be any doubt?  I was still four miles
from Carlisle, and it was now dark, and still pouring.
So I accepted gladly, and was very soon set down
in the city, at the door of a nice quiet Temperance
Hotel, suitable for a pilgrim in my sodden state.
</p>

<p>
The next morning was clear and bright, and I
made an early start for Old Wall, in order to follow
the stretch of Wall I had missed because of the
rain.
</p>

<p>
I will describe the walk from east to west as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
before, although I traversed it first from west to
east.
</p>

<p>
As I drew near to Bleatarn from Old Wall, I
noticed a tawny-brown duck-pond on the right.
This was part of the Wall-ditch.
</p>

<p>
Bleatarn itself is picturesquely situated on a
grassy hill, above a pond full of reeds (the "Blue
Tarn").  The whitewashed farm-house is very
attractive.  I called there for "a pot o' milk," as
the guidwife put it, and while she fetched it, I
noticed through the open door that the passage
running through the house was not ceiled, but
went right up into the rafters, past two floors.
</p>

<p>
The Wall runs to the north of the farm-house and
Tarn, so that it has the steep grassy bank of the
Tarn on its south side, and its own ditch on the
north.  The latter is almost as bold in its
proportions here as at Gap.
</p>

<p>
The Vallum runs immediately south of the
farm-house; and between it and the Wall, on the west
side of the farm-house, is a large mound.  This has
been proved, by excavations made by Professor
Haverfield and Mr. and Mrs. Hodgson, to be rubbish
from a quarry, worked in Roman times, and still in
use in mediæval times.  Roman quarrymen's marks
were found; also mediæval pottery.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
BLEATARN TO GRINSDALE
</h3>

<p>
From Bleatarn the road runs on the Wall
for some distance.  The undulating pastures
are exchanged for a marshy common,
covered with gorse, brambles and heather, and
known as "White Moss."  Here the Vallum is seen
to have four mounds instead of only two.  The
ground was too marshy to allow of the digging of a
ditch, so they raised two extra mounds to make a
hollow between, the ditch being the objective.  At
Bleatarn, where they get on to rock again, the four
mounds slide into two.
</p>

<p>
A Roman road crosses White Moss, and digging
has shown that it was made by laying grey clay on
the original surface, then a layer of coarse gravel,
and fine gravel on the top of that.
</p>

<p>
At Wallhead the ditch is very clearly seen in the
pasture-land.  The road on to Walby runs between
hedges, and beyond it merges into a grassy track,
so much overgrown that it is evidently seldom
trodden.  Near Wallhead it was muddy and full
of puddles from last night's rain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
</p>

<p>
It had turned out a very hot day, though there
was enough wind to make a thunderous sound in
the boughs of the still leafless ash-trees.  (Why do
bare ash-boughs beat all other trees for sound?)  As
I picked my way among the puddles, a little
red squirrel came running along, holding his tail
out very straight to keep it out of the mud.  I
stood like a rock, and he paid no heed to me, but
stopped to drink out of a puddle at my feet before
running up a tree.
</p>

<p>
When I reached the untrodden grassy track,
I took off my shoes and stockings and walked
bare-footed, the grass feeling deliciously cool and soft.
Broom in full blossom lined the hedges, almost
meeting overhead, and scattered its blossoms to
make a yellow carpet for my feet.
</p>

<p>
It was the drowsiest of days.  An old buff hen,
asleep by a gate, awoke with a start when a stick
snapped under me, but she only opened one eye,
and then "dropped off" again.  I saw no one else
but an Irish terrier, very happy and busy, and out
without leave, judging by his expression.
</p>

<p>
At Walby the Wall-ditch is clearly marked, filled
with greenish water.
</p>

<p>
The grassy lane continues to Wallfoot, and here
I had to come out on to the main road, for Brunstock
Park lies across the route of Wall and Vallum.  A
section through both was made in 1894 by Mr. and
Mrs. T. H. Hodgson; and the Vallum-ditch was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
first shown to be flat and not V-shaped.  A
flag-pavement was found near the Wall.  The Roman
Military Way was also discovered, with a double
kerb in the centre, as for a two-horse chariot.
</p>

<p>
I passed Draw-dykes Castle, with its three busts
on the roof, a very gaunt and unattractive building
of red sandstone; and then I turned off on the
right, where the road crosses Brunstock Beck, and
followed the beck until I struck the line of the Wall
once more.  The beck forms the western boundary
of Brunstock Park.
</p>

<p>
Some small boys with a fishmonger's truck were
collecting firewood in the meadow by the beck,
and thought everybody's quest must be the same.
"How many sticks have <i>you</i> got, missus?" they
cried as I passed.
</p>

<p>
The wall was easily traceable across the fields,
and led me out on to the Scaleby road, across the
road into more fields, and so to Tarraby.
</p>

<p>
Here I turned off to the left, to find the Near
Boot Inn, and get some tea.  I had met with a
small adventure near Tarraby, on my way out in
the morning.  I had my lunch of sandwiches and
biscuits in my pockets, and I was standing by
a field-gate, studying my Ordnance-map, when
suddenly there sprang upon me, out of the air
apparently, five greyhound pups.  Pups though
they were, their forepaws reached to my shoulders.
They were all over me in a moment; and, my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
hands being encumbered with the map, in saving
that I never gave a thought to my pockets.  Their
noses led them straight there, and before I realized
what they were about they had divided my lunch
between them, and were coming back for more!
They loved me so dearly after that that I could not
get rid of them for the distance of several fields.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of this I had had nothing since
breakfast but the "pot o' milk" at Bleatarn, so I
sought the Inn at Tarraby very hopefully.
</p>

<p>
But the landlady was not nearly so sure that she
wanted to give me some tea as I was that I wanted
to have it.  She did not actually refuse, but she
did all she could to discourage me.  She seemed
to think that if she was the <i>Near Boot</i>, then I was
certainly the "off leg"!  She had a bad headache,
and she hadn't any cake, nor any cream, nor much
of anything apparently.
</p>

<p>
However, I took "a deal o' discouraging," and
I sat on in the parlour and waited, for she had said:
"Well, anyhow, I must attend to these men first."
</p>

<p>
As I looked at the pictures on the parlour walls,
an idea suddenly dawned on me.
</p>

<p>
Every picture represented a prize greyhound!
</p>

<p>
When the landlady returned, I remarked casually
that I was very hungry because my lunch had been
stolen by five greyhound pups, and of course I
avoided showing the least tinge of resentment or
annoyance (having felt none!)  She did not say
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
much, but I noticed a change in her manner, and
when the tea did appear there were eggs and cake
and pastry, to say nothing of cream, and home-made
bread and butter and jam.  And, to crown all,
when I inquired for the headache, she said, "Do
you know, it has gone!"
</p>

<p>
So I did full justice to her tea, while the men in the
next room were telling each other what horses they
had backed for the Derby, and how much they had
lost.
</p>

<p>
Later, I learned that the landlord of the <i>Near
Boot</i> was a noted breeder of greyhounds.
</p>

<p>
From Tarraby the path along the Wall leads
through a wicket-gate into a pasture, with a
cinder-path along the hedge, and in this hedge Wall-stones
are clearly seen.  Then we go between two close-clipped
hedges of hawthorn and beech, with growing
crops, or plantations of baby trees, on either side.
This brings us out at Stanwix (Stane-wegges: a
place upon the "stone way").
</p>

<p>
Here we are on the site of another Roman fort,
occupying a commanding situation.  The church
and churchyard now indicate its position.  The
ground slopes down steeply on three sides, and the
river Eden draws a semi-circle round it, making
thus an additional protection on the east, south and
west.  No inscriptions have been found to tell us
what troops the Romans placed here, and no remains
of the Wall or the fort are to be seen.  The interesting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
stone-figure of a Roman playing the bagpipes,
which Hutton saw here used as a horseblock in the
street, and which is now in the Tullie House
Museum, Carlisle, was seen by a writer of 1794
"upon a door at Stanwix," and his illustration
shows the bagpipes much more clearly than the
stone does now.
</p>

<p>
Stanwix is now practically a suburb of Carlisle.
Here I saw a funny sight.  A baby in petticoats,
certainly not so much as two years old, was sitting
on his father's knee on a doorstep.  An old country-woman
was passing, lame in one leg, and with a very
irregular gait.  The baby looked at her, and began
to call out: "Left ... left ... left ..." at
regular intervals; and the old woman laughed
heartily at being thus drilled, pulled herself up, and
walked (as I fancied) rather less lame in consequence.
</p>

<p>
The Wall can be traced again near the Eden.  I
went down the road towards the famous Eden
Bridge, and through the iron gate on the right,
which is almost on the Vallum.  This brought me
into what seems to be the playground of Carlisle,
along the banks of the river,&mdash;a playground so
spacious that though half the city seemed to have
come out to play this lovely evening, there still
seemed any amount of room.  The turf was very
fresh and green and beautiful on the undulating
slopes which run down to the river.  Two stone
posts on the bank above Hyssop Holme Well have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
been placed to mark the site of the Wall and its ditch
in this region, but there is nothing to show exactly
where it crossed the Eden.
</p>

<p>
In order to trace its farther course as closely as
possible, I referred the next morning to the 6-inch
Ordnance-map in the Tullie House Museum.  This
shows how the Wall, after crossing the river, passed
to the north of the Castle Hill, while the Vallum
curved round to the south of it.  Guided by the
map, I followed the Wall as closely as I could,
picking up traces here and there.
</p>

<p>
Starting from in front of the Castle, I went down
Annetwell Street and Bridge Street, turning off by
Bridge Lane on the right to Willowholme, where
there is a disused mill.  Leaving the mill on the
right, I crossed a footpath, and then a footbridge
over a stream, and bore round to the left, following
this diminutive tributary of the Eden.  The path
soon crosses under the railway, and now we are
again on the site of the Wall!
</p>

<p>
I found this a very unfrequented route, and the
sluggish, gnat-beset little stream was not very
attractive; but I was out to follow the Wall wherever
it led me, no matter where.  To-day it led me past
the sewage-works, to a footpath by the Eden.
The old disused bone-mill of Rattlingstones, with
its high chimney and its still busy mill-race, was on
my left.  I stopped to look at the frothy water.
What was that it was toying with, tossing backwards
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
and forwards, hiding and then revealing?  I could
hardly believe my eyes.  It was a <i>mattress</i>, a nice
large double-bed mattress, in excellent condition!
Now how <i>did</i> it get there?  Mattresses are not the
sort of thing one leaves about by mistake, or drops
when one is out for a walk.  I was obliged to go on
without solving the problem.
</p>

<p>
Under the wide stone railway-bridge I passed
next, and so came to the engine-sheds mentioned
by Dr. Bruce.  I crossed a footbridge, with steam
from the engine-sheds puffing all round me, and so
came to a stile which brought me out into the open
fields which lie above the Eden&mdash;and here once more
is Wall!
</p>

<p>
The left bank of the river is very high and
precipitous, while the right bank is a gentle slope.  I
had no difficulty in finding the site of the Wall in
these fields, nor in walking along it; and the Vallum
runs parallel, a short distance to the south.
</p>

<p>
Now the walk is really beautiful, all the way to
Grinsdale.  Trees grow in profusion on the steep
river bank, and the blue river below gleams up
through their branches.
</p>

<p>
On the opposite bank a ploughman was cheering
on his horses, and fishers were spreading out their
nets to dry.
</p>

<p>
At a bend in the stream, Grinsdale came into
view, and soon the path entered a delicious
fir-plantation, with the resinous smell brought out by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
the hot sun.  Two men carrying huge sacks of
firewood reminded me again of the coal-strike.
</p>

<p>
Just about here the Vallum and the Wall begin
to diverge, the Wall following the river to Grinsdale,
and the Vallum striking straight across the
lower ground through Millbeck to Kirkandrews.
</p>

<p>
The railway-line to Silloth comes very close to
the river here; in fact, the two have been running
more or less alongside all the way from Rattlingstones,
but I never knew a river so clever in hiding
itself as the Eden.  A traveller by train to Silloth
would not guess he was quite close to a large
river, so shyly does it conceal itself behind its steep
southern bank.
</p>

<p>
After flowing in a northerly direction towards
Grinsdale, it makes a sharp right-angled turn just
at the village, and flows eastward past the church.
</p>

<p>
Grinsdale is a very pretty village, standing high
up on this loop of the Eden, with the gardens of
the houses sloping steeply down to the water.  It
seemed half asleep as I reached it.  I came out into
the road by a farm-house, making a mental note for
future use of the sign it displayed: "Aerated
Waters."  I met no one in the village street but a
farmer in his shirt-sleeves, who took his pipe out
of his mouth to ejaculate, "Hot!"  I took the
opportunity before he put it in again to ask about
the Roman Wall.  He said he had heard there was
a bit standing near the church, but he had never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
seen it.  So I turned off to the right, into fields
which led to the church, following the bend of the
river.
</p>

<p>
It seemed hotter and quieter than ever.  A swan
was standing asleep on one leg on the gravelly flat
by the water's edge.  In the churchyard the rooks
were cawing drowsily, and dropped dead branches
on me as I passed.  It is a tiny church, with a
tiny tower, all rough cast, and it stands on the
very brink of the steep river bank.  It is protected
on the river-side by a strong stone wall into which
Wall-stones have been built.  A breakwater, also
containing Wall-stones, runs down into the river,
to protect the church wall.  But as for Wall itself,
I saw I was quite off the track.
</p>

<p>
Still, I was not sorry to sit and rest for a while in
the cool of the churchyard.
</p>

<p>
On the opposite bank of the river, where it had
encroached on the land, men were busy sinking
piles&mdash;long, long rows of them&mdash;and bringing up
loads of brushwood to build up the bank, and
prevent further inroads.
</p>

<p>
Seeing them working so hard in the sun made me
feel quite thirsty, and, remembering the sign I had
seen at the farm, I turned back to find it.  Such a
comely farmer's wife answered my knock that I
ventured to ask for tea instead of aerated water.
She said: "Yes, if ye can wait a bit till I have made
up the butter."  Of course I could wait, so I went
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
off to explore the village a little more.  A
pleasant-faced elderly woman was driving a herd of cows
out of a gate, so I asked my eternal question about
the Wall.  She said: "If ye want to know aught
aboot Grinsdel, go to that hoose there," pointing with
her finger.  "<i>He'll</i> tell ye; I'm a newcomer."
</p>

<p>
Just then "he" came into his front garden, so
she hailed him, and passed me on.  He told me
where to pick up the line of the Wall again, and then
he invited me in, to look at some old books etc.
that he had, apologizing for "the litter" (which
was invisible to me) because the housekeeper was
away, and he and his brother were "doing for"
themselves.  He showed me an old Malacca cane,
such as Joey Bagstock must have carried, with an
ivory handle and a silver ring.  It was inscribed:
"David Stagg, 1701," and its pointed iron end
looked as if David had been a heavy man, and had
leant heavily upon it.  Finally he left me in his
parlour, happily absorbed in Hutchinson's <i>History
of Cumberland</i> (1794), and with his assurance that I
should be "well oot o' the road there" for as long
as I pleased.  So if there is a Sherlock Holmes
amongst my readers, when he notices hereafter the
date 1794, he may possibly guess whence the facts
that go with it were obtained.
</p>

<p>
The butter was on the very point of coming out
of the churn when I reappeared at the farm.  "Come
and look at it!" cried the guidwife; "it's just
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
beautiful."  And she picked up a jug of water
and poured it into the churn.  But, alas! she had
left the cork out, and the water was splashing all
round us on the stone floor of the dairy.  I flew into
the kitchen, where I had noticed the cork, and
returned in triumph with it, to be met with an
approving, "Why, ye'll mak' a farmer's wife yet!"
</p>

<p>
Then I had to "taste" the butter, to see if it
was salt enough; and finally to taste it in a more
satisfactory way, in the form of bread and butter
with my tea.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
GRINSDALE TO DRUMBURGH
</h3>

<p>
To follow the Wall to Kirkandrews, I had to
cross the village street, and pass through
a farm-yard gate beside a letter-box.
This brought me out into meadows.  Such a
beautiful golden meadow was the first which came,
with dark-grey guinea-fowls making a foil to the
buttercups, and giant trees here and there.  In the
shade of one large chestnut-tree, a handsome lad
was shearing sheep.  I drew near to watch, and
the clip, clip of his shears, together with the
bleating of the waiting sheep, prevented his hearing me,
so I waited till one sheep was quite finished before
venturing to move or make a sound.  Then I spoke,
and he jumped.  "How quiet they are while they
are being shorn!"  "Yes," said he, with a smile.
"You never hear the sheep saying anything then;
they say it all before.  I think they are glad to get
rid of it; it weighs about nine or ten pounds."  As
I looked at the snowy whiteness of the inside of the
fleece, I thought how much we town-dwellers miss
in the imagery of the Bible which must come home
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
with great force to a pastoral people, such as the
Jews themselves were.  "White as wool" and "As
a sheep before her shearers is dumb."
</p>

<p>
I found only faint traces of the Wall here and there
on the way to Kirkandrews, in the pasture-land,
and as a mound running through a young cornfield.
In 1794 it was "very visible."  The churchyard
at Kirkandrews is a mass of stones, and Dr. Bruce
thought a mile-castle stood there.  There has been
no church for many years.  In the eighteenth
century the burial service was still read under the
ruins of the old chancel arch, but the parish has
been joined to Beaumont since 1692.
</p>

<p>
The Vallum and the Wall come together again
at Kirkandrews, but they meet only to part, for
the Wall climbs to Beaumont, clinging for a little
longer to the high bank of the Eden, and the Vallum
makes a straight course for Burgh-by-sands (usually
called just "Bruff").
</p>

<p>
Near Kirkandrews was found the interesting stone
described by Dr. Bruce&mdash;an altar, cut down for
building purposes, commemorating the achievements
of the sixth legion, "prosperously performed
beyond the Wall" (<i>ob res trans Vallum prospere
gestas</i>).  Lord Lonsdale had it taken away.
</p>

<p>
The Wall continues its course not far from the
road leading to Beaumont, on the right.  The
Wall-ditch is seen again where the Wall crosses the
Beaumont Beck.  The church at Beaumont is right
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
on the line of the Wall, and is partly built of Roman
stones; it may be on the site of another mile-castle.
</p>

<p>
A farm-yard gate on the right of the church
leads to a lane, which runs actually on the Wall.
This merges into a grassy track, evidently seldom
used, and getting gradually more impassable.
Finally I found myself still on the Wall, but creeping
on hands and knees through a tunnel of thick
hawthorn growth, where it was impossible to stand
upright.  The farmer had not considered the
convenience of pilgrims of the Wall, for I found myself
obliged to squeeze through barbed wire fences,
and through masses of dead boughs and brambles
which blocked my way.  However, as every pilgrim
knows, difficulties, seen rightly, are only things to
be overcome, and presently the obstructions ceased
to appear, and the Wall sloped gradually and
peacefully down to the main road, taking me across the
Powburgh Beck, and finally out into the road quite
close to Burgh Church.
</p>

<p>
Burgh was "the longest village in Cumberland,"
according to Hutton.  It is the site of one of the
forts along the Wall, the exact position of which
has only recently been ascertained.
</p>

<p>
The church is very solidly built, mainly of stones
from the Wall and fort; it has a square tower,
the walls of which are 7 feet thick.  I fetched the
key from the Vicarage, a modern brick building,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
and explored it by myself.  It has been classed
as a "fortified church," and it is thought that the
iron door which separates the tower from the rest
of the building was to enable it to stand a short
siege if necessary.  The view from the top of the
tower is well worth seeing, especially away to the
north, across the Burgh Marsh, to the Eden, winding
through the sands, and with the hills of
Dumfriesshire beyond.
</p>

<p>
The pretty Old Vicarage, next the church, is a
long, low whitewashed house with very small
windows.  There are indications that a door in its
west wall once opened into the churchyard.  The
date on the cottage next door, which looks about
the same age, is 1672.
</p>

<p>
Thirty years ago, when the new Vicarage was
built, this one was sold for £150.  It has just been
sold again, and put into repair, and a rent of £50
is being asked for it.  The old and new Vicarages
and the cottage between are the very first houses
in the long village street.  As I walked westward
I noticed many clay houses.  They have very thick
walls, as much as 4 feet thick, and are usually
whitewashed over the clay, but sometimes great
patches of brownish-grey clay interrupt the white
surface.  Stone window-jambs, lintels and door-posts
are used, and the roofs are thatched, except
where corrugated iron has, alas! replaced the
original thatch.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
</p>

<p>
A tall, thin old man, driving some cows, passed
me while I was looking at one of these houses, and
remarked that they were very warm and
comfortable to live in.  I asked him about the Roman
Wall, and he said folks did not trouble about it
much, but he could show me a bit of it, if I would
wait till he had got the cows in.  So I walked
alongside till we came to his house, which was of
clay, as I had guessed it would be.  Outside there
was a pump, and a stone trough whose edges were
scalloped in exactly the same way as the Roman
stone troughs at Borcovicium and elsewhere.  I
asked him why it was scalloped, and he replied
that they always sharpened their tools on it, thus
confirming the usual theory.
</p>

<p>
He then took me to Hungerhill Lane, a turning
off the north side of the main street, and there,
not many paces along, he showed me the Wall,
crossing the lane at right-angles, the stones level
with the ground.  It was nearly three yards wide,
and very clearly discernible right across the lane;
by far the best piece I have seen in any road since
I started.  He told me he had lifted a good many
stones in his time, from a field farther west, but
that they "perished" when uncovered&mdash;which
last I found difficult to believe.
</p>

<p>
Walking to Bleatarn from Carlisle, I had come
across a young ex-service man who hailed from
Burgh.  He was very obliging in giving me such
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
archæological information as he possessed, but it
was not exact enough to be of much use.
</p>

<p>
Old Miss Sally &mdash;&mdash;, at Burgh, so he said, had a
Roman stone in her garden with a terrible far-back
date; anyhow, it was A.D. <i>something</i>!  It was
covered with moss, and she had got him to clean
it.  The church at Burgh was built of Roman
stones, and he had been to the top many a time;
it looked a terrible long way down.  When he was
a boy it was said there was treasure hidden under
King Edward the First's Monument, and a terrible
big crowd had collected, with flags flying, and ever
such a to-do, wanting to dig it up, but they were
not allowed.
</p>

<p>
He told me he had joined up at once in 1914,
going straight off from Carlisle, without ever
returning home to say good-bye to his father and
mother.  He just left his bicycle with his sister,
and went off, not knowing he would be gone four
and a half years!  No doubt there were many such.
He only had two "leaves" home all the time.
</p>

<p>
However, he came through all right; some
pretty hot times, but he came through.  And he
saw some terrible nice places in Italy on the way
home from Salonika.
</p>

<p>
He was such a cheery fellow that I was "terrible
glad" to have come across him, although I did
not feel much wiser when our ways parted.
</p>

<p>
The Vallum is clearly seen in Burgh, running
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
through pasture-land to the north of the road.  The
Wall goes close behind West-end farm-house, and
then&mdash;<i>via</i> Watch Hill&mdash;to Dykesfield, which may
be recognized by its well-kept lawns, on one of
which stands a Roman altar.  Rhododendrons
were in full flower in the garden, and dark yew trees
round them made their rich colour look even richer.
Here the Vallum is thought to end, but the
Wall goes straight on down to the level of the
marsh.  It cannot be traced again between this
point and Drumburgh, two and a half miles farther
on.
</p>

<p>
It seems a very long two and a half miles across
the marsh on a hot day, for it is a perfectly straight
and level road, unsheltered by a single tree.  The
railway between Carlisle and Port Carlisle runs
alongside, having succeeded the canal.  Signs of
the canal can be seen at intervals, where lock-gates
are placed to hold up the streams that run into the
Eden through the marsh.  The marsh is a
grazing-ground for many sheep and cattle.
</p>

<p>
To the north of Burgh can be seen the monument
erected to mark the spot where King Edward I. died
in his tent on 7th July 1307.  He was encamped
there with a large army, awaiting a favourable
opportunity to cross the Sol way and enter Scotland.
Tradition says that he had been warned in a dream
that he would die at Burgh, so he had purposely
avoided coming through a place of that name in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
Yorkshire.  On arriving here, he asked an old
woman what the place was called, and heard to his
surprise the fateful name.  A monument was first
placed here in 1685, by the Duke of Norfolk, on the
site of the heap of stones that had marked the spot;
but after a hundred years it began to lean to the
west, and in 1795 it fell.  So the Earl of Lonsdale
rebuilt it on a much larger base in 1803.
</p>

<p>
The village of Boustead Hill is seen half-way
across the marsh, to the south of the road&mdash;a mere
sprinkling of houses on a grassy knoll.
</p>

<p>
I passed no one on these 2½ miles but a shepherd,
and a young couple with a motor-bicycle and trailer.
They were seated on the top of the grassy dyke;
she was winding wool, and he was holding the skein.
As I passed, I said: "It's a gran' day," in the
approved style of the country, and they cordially
assented.
</p>

<p>
Near Drumburgh Station there is a house where
I was told a horse and cart could be hired, so I
called to engage it for my return journey, as trains
are few and far between.  But, alas! "he" was
out, "leading peat," till the evening, and then was
engaged to fetch some one from "Port," for the
eight o'clock train.  However "she" was quite
willing to give me some tea.  She had had her own
long ago, at three o'clock (for dinner was always at
11.30), so the kettle was not boiling but soon would.
I was invited into the kitchen, where "oor Tho'"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
as he called himself, stopped playing with his dolls
to help his mother fetch sticks, and to wake the
dying embers of the kitchen fire.  "Oor Tho'"
was five, and "oor Maggie," who returned from
school shortly, was a year or so older.  Although
their ages were reversed, they made me think very
much of the two Tullivers, not only because of the
similarity of the names.
</p>

<p>
Drumburgh village is entered through a white
gate across the road, at the end of the marsh.  Just
inside the gate, on the left, is Drumburgh Castle, an
old fortified manor-house now used as a farm-house.
John Leland, in his famous <i>Itinerary</i>, writes thus
of it in 1539:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"At Drumburgh the Lord Dacre's father builded
upon old ruines a pretty pyle for defence of the
country.  The stones of the Pict Wall were pulled
down to build it."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And again:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Drumburgh ys in ye mydde way betwixt
Bolness and Burgh.  The stones of the Picts Wall
were pulled down to build Drumburgh, for the
Wall is very nere it."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A royal licence to fortify the older building had
been granted in 1307.
</p>

<p>
Above the main entrance, a coat-of-arms and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
initials "T.D.," for Thomas Dacre, are seen, carved
in stone; and two stone griffins with outspread
wings are perched high up on a level with the
chimneys.  There is a fine flight of steps up to the
main door, which is a heavy oak door studded
thickly with nails.  The steps and balustrade, when
I saw them, were coated with red ochre, such as
is used for marking sheep.  They told me this was
done to preserve the stone, and prevent moss from
growing on it.  The ochre is mixed with buttermilk,
and then it does not wash off, and the steps
are never slippery for walking on.
</p>

<p>
But, oh, the vandalism of it!  Even the Roman
altar which stands at the top of the steps had been
given its coat of brick-red!  Is it worth preserving
the stones at such a cost?  I could not help picturing
to myself a brick-red Roman Wall, running
along the tops of the crags!  Ugh!
</p>

<p>
The present occupiers are not responsible, for
they have merely carried on the tradition of their
predecessors, and the "doorstep" custom of the
neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
I called at a less pretentious entrance, which
was evidently mostly used, and asked for permission
to see inside the Castle.  The farmer's wife was
busy at the time, but she kindly promised to show
me round on my return journey from Bowness.
</p>

<p>
I will describe the interior here, though I saw it
later.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
</p>

<p>
Its chief beauty is its panelled room, the principal
room of the house, on the first floor, with windows
looking north and south, across the village street
in front, and over the garden behind.  The walls
are completely covered with beautiful oak panelling,
the panels being about a foot square.  In this room
I was amused to see a reproduction of a picture of
my own, which had found its way to this remote
spot, <i>via</i> "Bibby's Annual."
</p>

<p>
We went up on to the roof to see the view, which
is very fine.  Battlements still protect it at the
western end.  On the way up we passed over a floor
with holes in it, and my guide begged me to be
careful.  Blackness of darkness was visible through
the holes, and she told me I was looking into a sealed
room.  Presently she showed me where the door
leading into it had been covered up and whitewashed
over; and when I looked up later at the
front of the house, I saw the window had been filled
in with two large blocks of stone and cemented
over.  All this seemed very mysterious, but the
mistress of the house treated it in a perfectly
matter-of-fact way.  "I'm very glad," said she;
"there's a deal to keep clean as it is; no doubt they
thought so too, whoever did it.  But the servant-girls
hear stories in the village, and sometimes they
won't stop."
</p>

<p>
She unbolted the heavy oak door to let me out.
That entrance is never used, so the wide hall of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
manor-house is now merely a bare whitewashed
store-room, hung with hams, and decorated with
bacon.
</p>

<p>
In an illustrated edition of Sir Walter Scott's
<i>Redgauntlet</i>, published in 1832, a picture of
Drumburgh Castle is given, as the "Fairladies" of the
tale.
</p>

<p>
Drumburgh is the site of a small fort on the Wall,
some remains of which were found in 1899.  The
ditch behind the Castle is not the Wall-ditch.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
DRUMBURGH TO BOWNESS
</h3>

<p>
From Drumburgh Castle I continued my
way through the village, where there are
many clay houses.  Nothing of the Wall is
to be seen until after a sharp double turn in the
road.  Here, after the second turn, I saw the
Wall-ditch plainly in a meadow to the south of the road;
this was just after passing the schools, where a
young master was drilling the boys and girls with
a great assumption of sternness.  The Wall can be
traced at intervals in the fields to the south, following
pretty closely the line of the road as far as Port
Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
Nearing Glasson, both Wall and road turn towards
the sea.  At the cross-roads to the north of Glasson,
the tall chimneys of the Dornock works in Dumfriesshire
are seen across the Solway, straight ahead
along the road we are travelling.  Soon after this,
the road runs along close to the sea, with only a
grassy stretch between, and then Port Carlisle
comes into view.  The core of the Wall is to be
seen occasionally on the left.  Three farms stand
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
here, facing the sea&mdash;Lowtown, Westfield and
Kirkland.
</p>

<p>
Port Carlisle was known as Fisher's Cross before
the canal to Carlisle was opened in 1823.  The
attempt to make it the port of Carlisle was a failure,
owing to the tendency of the harbour to get silted
up with sand and mud.  In 1854 the canal was filled
up as far as Drumburgh, and a railway made on its
site.  Docks were constructed at Silloth, and the
railway continued to that point.
</p>

<p>
Until recently travellers to Port Carlisle had to
continue their journey from Drumburgh in a
"horse-dandy," drawn along the dry bed of the canal.
Now the railway goes all the way; and one of the
dandies, painted Indian red, occupies a distinguished
position as an "antiquity" opposite the platform
of the railway station, while the other serves in the
lowlier capacity of a hen-house close by.
</p>

<p>
Port Carlisle consists of a single street of
comfortable-looking stone houses facing the sea.  A
well-kept bowling-green and tennis-courts near the station
provide amusement for the railway servants in the
long intervals between trains.  It was all interval
when I was there, for this part of the line was closed
during the coal-strike.
</p>

<p>
The jetty where the boats used to unload is now
in a ruinous condition.  The sea has broken through
it, so at high tide the far end is a grass-grown island
where visitors have been cut off from escape by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
water.  I looked for the Packet Hotel where the
fragment of an altar, inscribed "MATRIBVS SVIS,"
is built in over the door, and I found it was no
longer an Inn, but a farm-house, the last house in the
long street, just where the coast-line begins to bend
round towards Bowness.
</p>

<p>
I had seen no trace of the Wall since passing
Kirkland, but I knew I ought to be able to pick it up
here, so I walked round behind the ex-hotel, and
began to look about.  A girl was sitting sewing in
the doorway of a cottage, and I asked if she could
help me.  "Oh yes," she said; "I'll fetch my
father."  An old man appeared, with a pot of
green paint in one hand and a paint-brush in the
other.
</p>

<p>
"You have come to the right man," said he.
</p>

<p>
Then, with a dramatic wave of the paint-brush,
"The Roman Wall passed by this very doorstep."  He
gave me full instructions as to how to find it
farther on:
</p>

<p>
"Follow along the road to Bo'ness till you come
to a gooter across the road, then turn to the left up
a grassing-field, and go on till you come to an elbow.
Turn to the right, and you come to a high lift;
over that lift you'll find the Wall."
</p>

<p>
I obeyed these instructions as closely as I could,
but I made the mistake of following a closed gutter
instead of an open one, and this involved me in
several unexpected difficulties.  I reached the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
Wall-line sooner than my guide had intended, and the
farmers about here seem to tax their ingenuity to
make it as difficult as possible to follow that line.
I crept under barbed wire into a "grassing" field
and safely reached the hedge.  Here were undoubted
signs of Wall-core.  I followed it to the hedge of
the next field, and there I stopped.  The hedge
seemed quite impregnable, and there was no gate;
all the hedges were of the thickest, and even if I
could have made a hole, it would have been
contrary to my code.  I turned back to see if I could
find an opening into the field on my left.  A large
ash-tree grew in the hedge, and without much
trouble I climbed into its lower boughs, and could
then make a drop of 6 feet into the next field.  But
again I was done!  There was a gate on the west,
it is true, but it was locked, and so thickly
interlaced with thorn-bushes that I could not climb it.
There was nothing for it but to reclimb my ash-tree,
and have another look at my first hedge.  I now
saw that the end of a long ladder was laid flat
on the top of this hedge, and rested on a gate-post
in the field of my desire.  Great masses of
thorn-bush were heaped up under the ladder, which had
evidently been thrown across as an additional
barrier.  Here was an opportunity to turn an enemy
into a friend!  I pulled myself up on to the ladder,
walked from rung to rung over the thorn-bushes,
and jumped off at the end, feeling that I had scored
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
one over the farmer, for I had circumvented him
without damaging his property.  The next hedge
was of thorn-trees growing on the ground, and there
was just one small hole, between two trunks, big
enough for me to creep through.  And then I saw
a fine piece of Wall&mdash;only the core, but several feet
high, and in very good condition.  A gateway had
been cut right through it, and in the section the
formation and the Roman mortar could be readily
examined.  The Wall-ditch was just discernible
on its north side.
</p>

<p>
William Hutton says of this part of the Wall:
"One mile prior to the extremity of our journey
and at the distance of one inclosure on our left,
appears in majesty, for the last time, Severus's
Wall, being five or six hundred yards long, and three
feet high, but, as in the mountains, all confusion.
A fence grows upon it * * * In two places it is six
feet high, eight broad, and three thick; but has no
facing-stones."  Dr. Bruce says that gunpowder
was used in bringing it down.
</p>

<p>
It was after this that I came to the "elbow."  The
Wall-ditch was to be seen from the elbow
running through the pasture to the next hedge.  I
followed, scrambling down the steep bank of a
burn, and up the other side amid gorse and hawthorn,
into a cart-track, with the Wall now on my right.
The burn now served as the Wall-ditch.
</p>

<p>
I was quite near to the houses of Bowness by this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
time, and a gate on my left across the meadow
brought me into a narrow lane, and thus into the
road, not far from the church.
</p>

<p>
In the churchyard I saw a man in light tweeds
carrying a bucket of water.  He asked me courteously
if I would like to have the key of the church, and I
found I was addressing the Rector.  Except for a
very beautiful Norman font, there is nothing
remarkable about the church.
</p>

<p>
From the main street I made my way through a
little iron gate opposite the "King's Arms," down
a steep grassy slope, and on to the shore by means
of a rickety, rusty iron ladder, riveted by one leg
to a rock.  The view was lovely across the sands.
On my left, crossing the Solway, was the Annan
Railway Bridge, which had just been condemned
as unsafe, and Criffel showed in a violet haze
beyond it.
</p>

<p>
I thought from the sands I could best distinguish
the probable site of the Roman fort, and I believe
that I did succeed in identifying the western rampart,
and the south-west and north-west angles.
</p>

<p>
Bowness is a quiet little place, standing high up
above the Solway, with steep cobbled streets and
many clay houses, "whose walls," said an old
inhabitant to me, "are as thick as my stick is long."  As
seen from the ridge above the road to the west
of the village, eight strips of colour, gradually
receding, make up my impression of the view.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
First a strip of white road, then a strip of green
grass; beyond that, a strip of yellow gorse; behind
the gorse, a strip of marshland, pink with sea-thrift;
then a strip of yellow dry sand, then a strip
of brown wet sand; beyond that the blue water
of the Solway, and, last of all, the blue-grey distance
of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
There were fishing-smacks on the Solway, and
there were fishermen fishing with their "half-nets"
for salmon and trout.
</p>

<p>
Camden says of this part: "I marvailed at first,
why they built here so great fortifications, considering
that for eight miles or thereabout, there lieth
opposite a very great frith and arme of the sea;
but now I understand that every ebbe the water
is so low, that the Borderers and beast-stealers may
easily wade over."  And he records how, in 1216,
they came, and having stayed too long were swept
away by the tide.  His quaint words (or rather,
Dr. Philemon Holland's quaint translation of them)
are worth quoting:
</p>

<p>
"For Eden, that notable river, * * * powreth
forth into a mighty masse of water, having not
yet forgotten what adoe it had to pass away,
struggling and wrestling as it did, among the carcasses
of freebutters, lying dead in it on heapes, in
the yeer of salvation, 1216, when it swallowed them
up, loaden with booties out of England, and so
buried that rabble of robbers under his waves."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
I searched about for the end of the Wall, where
it was supposed to run northwards into the water,
and was just about to give it up in despair, when I
saw an old lady in a black sunbonnet leaning over
the gate of a pretty little cottage.  I got into
conversation with her, and then of her own accord she
told me that the Roman Wall ended in her garden,
"behind that apple-tree."  She spoke of the
gentlemen who had come to investigate, and how they
had followed it down from her garden to the shore,
by the old schoolhouse, which is now used by the
fishermen for keeping their nets.  She added:
"There's not many that sets any store by the
Roman Wall here&mdash;only me."
</p>

<p>
So here I was, having actually arrived at my
goal, at the end of my walk of 73½ miles&mdash;not as
the crow flies, but as the Wall runs.  I had made
it probably twice as far, by digressions and
excursions.  For the present I felt I had had enough
walking; I wanted to indulge in a lift; so I began
to inquire for a pony and trap to take me back
to Drumburgh Castle.  I soon found one at an
innocent-looking house in the village street, which
turned out to be a farm-house, with a yard and
byres at the back.  The farmer's daughter, who
drove me, asked me why I did not spend the night
at Bowness.  I told her that I had engaged a room
at Carlisle because I could not be sure of getting a
bed at Bowness; and I related my experiences on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
the way to Carlisle.  "Oh," she cried, "Bo'nes
people isn't like <i>that</i>!  <i>They'd</i> no see you bet.
Why, I'd give up my own bed to any one rather than
let them go without.  Folks say I'll be took in some
day, but <i>I</i> don't mind."
</p>

<p>
As we drove down the village street, she pointed
out to me the Roman altar, mentioned by Bruce,
built into an outhouse near the King's Arms.  It is
dedicated to Jupiter, for the welfare of the Emperors
Gallus and Volusian, so it dates from about 251 A.D.
</p>

<p>
After visiting Drumburgh Castle, I went by train
to Kirkandrews.  A stout lady in the train asked
me if I had been to Bowness.  "Ah!" she said,
"I know it well; I've been to many a funeral
there.  They bury them there from Glasson, and
from Drumburgh, and I think from Kirkbride.
It's a nice place, Bo'nes, to be buried."  I inquired
what were the special advantages.  "Well, well, I
can't exactly say, but it's a nice place, is Bo'nes;
I'd as lief be buried there myself.  My husband's
father, he was a canal man, lived for twenty years
on a houseboat on the canal; and <i>he's</i> buried at
Bo'nes."
</p>

<p>
And that was all the explanation I could get.
</p>

<p>
From Kirkandrews I walked back to Carlisle,
first through Grinsdale, and then along the track
of the Wall above the Eden.  It was such a lovely
evening!  My shadow was cast by the lowering
sun half across the blue waters of the Eden, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
Carlisle Castle and Cathedral appeared at intervals
over the stone railway bridge, glowing in the warm
light.  As I neared Carlisle, the meadows were alive
with children of all ages, enjoying the beautiful
close of a hot day.  Miners on strike were racing
their whippets; small boys with hatchets were
chopping off dead boughs for firewood on the steep
tree-covered river banks; children were bathing
and paddling from the rocks by the engine-house.
A sweet smell of may was in the air.  And I had
a satisfied sense of "something accomplished,
something done."  The week's walk had been delightful,
and my acquaintance with the Wall had been much
extended and deepened; and yet I was not wholly
sorry to return to civilized habits, and to unstrap
my haversack from my shoulders for the last time.
</p>

<p>
But I had not quite said good-bye to the tramp
I had been.
</p>

<p>
The following afternoon I left Carlisle to spend a
day or two with friends in Northumberland, picking
up my suit-case in Newcastle.
</p>

<p>
When I went up to dress for dinner that evening,
I found to my horror that the maid had unpacked
my <i>tramp's</i> luggage, and distributed it about the
room, while the suit-case was still locked and the
key in my pocket!
</p>

<p>
And there were my poor, pathetic little bedroom-slippers,
which I had had no chance of discarding
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
since I wore through their soles on the crags; there
they were, spread out in such incongruous
surroundings!
</p>

<p>
I sat down, and laughed and laughed and
laughed.  I could do nothing else.  And then I
gathered everything together and restored it to
the haversack, strapping it up firmly, and
consigning it to oblivion until such time as I could
sort it out properly, ready for my next tramp.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
VINDOLANDA, CORSTOPITUM, BEWCASTLE
</h3>

<p>
There are a few places not within the line
of a direct walk along the Wall from sea
to sea which yet form part of our subject,
because they have close associations with the Wall.
</p>

<p>
The most important of these is actually one of
the forts <i>per lineam Valli</i>, though it lies a mile
to the south of the Wall.  This is called Vindolana
on the <i>Notitia</i> list, but a recently discovered altar
shows the correct spelling of the name to have
been VINDOLANDA.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="noindent" style="font-weight: bold">
VINDOLANDA.
</p>

<p>
The fort of Vindolanda is at Chesterholm, about
a mile south from Hotbank on the Wall.  To reach
it, we can take a turning on the south side of
Wade's Road, near Bradley Hall, keeping to the
left, or we can cut across the fields from Highshield
farm-house.
</p>

<p>
The green platform of the fort stands out very
conspicuously, and will be easily recognized by any
one who is getting to know what to look for.  It
rises up immediately to the west of the little hamlet
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
of Chesterholm, half buried in its nest of trees;
and the heathery hill of Barcombe shelters both
from the east winds.
</p>

<p>
If we approach the fort by the road, it brings
us past a Roman milestone, the only one still
standing in its original position on the Stanegate,
which runs east and west here.  The milestone
stands about 5 feet above the ground and is about
6 feet in circumference.
</p>

<p>
Vindolanda is supposed to be one of Agricola's
forts on the Stanegate.
</p>

<p>
The walls, gateways and ditches can be readily
made out, also the hypocaustal pillars of a large
building to the west of the fort.  I sat on the
outer wall of the fort to make a sketch of Chesterholm
in the evening light, with heathery Barcombe
beyond, and the Long Stone standing up against
the sky.  No one knows the age of the Long Stone.
I was up there one day when two tourists passed.
They saw the date "1784" cut on its base by an
earlier tourist.  "Oh, that's the date it was set up,"
said they, and hurried on.  The top has been broken
off, and joined with iron bands cemented in; and
there is a similar join at the base.  It stands
between two large stones which keep it in place,
and these look in the distance like a pedestal for
the column.
</p>

<p>
There is a British camp near the Long Stone,
and also a Roman quarry, where the famous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
"Thorngrafton Find" of Roman coins was made.
There are no coins later than Hadrian's in the
collection, which tends to confirm the already
well-established fact that Hadrian, and no later Emperor,
built the Wall.
</p>

<p>
A glorious view is to be had from Barcombe of
the "mural ridge," all the way from Sewingshields
to the Nine Nicks.
</p>

<p>
In the valley of Chesterholm there is a cottage
built of Roman stones, where some beautiful
coping-stones and other sculptured stones are preserved,
built into a covered passage, approached by slippery
stone steps.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="noindent" style="font-weight: bold">
THE ROMAN MILESTONE.
</p>

<p>
To the north of the milestone is a large artificial
mound, possibly the burial-place of a British chief.
One day, when I was painting the milestone, there
were young black cattle feeding on this mound,
quite a number of them.  Suddenly I heard a
sound of trampling hoofs above me, and down they
came, the whole crowd, at full speed.  I sat tight,
hoping they would not upset me, for a thorn-tree
hid me where I sat.  However, the tide did not
flow quite in my direction, and they gathered
round the milestone, and did nothing worse than
obstruct my view.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
THE ROMAN MILE-STONE ON THE STANEGATE, NEAR VINDOLANDA, <br>
WITH BARCOMBE, RISING BEHIND THE TREES
</p>

<p>
A boy on a bicycle came by, and stopped to look
at the stone, chattering away to me while I worked:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
</p>

<p>
"What age is the old thing?  About 80 A.D.?
Well, he has stuck it out!  Wonder how much of
him there is underground.  As much again, I
suppose.  I say, did you have difficulty in getting
water-colour paper during the War?  No?  Well,
lucky you didn't!  Chaps in the Government office
I worked in, they'd get out a half-crown sheet of
Whatman when they wanted a table-cloth for tea!
Lot of that sort of thing done.  Shame, I call it.
Flies are a nuisance here; don't you find them so?
No?  Well, I do.  Good morning."
</p>

<p>
And off he went.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="noindent" style="font-weight: bold">
CORSTOPITUM.
</p>

<p>
I had heard from various sources that I must not
miss seeing the Roman town of Corstopitum at
Corbridge; but on my first attempt, when I motored
with friends to the little town on the Cor Burn, we
only succeeded in finding a field-gate with a notice
up, "Excavations closed."  So obediently we went
away, only to be told afterwards how foolish we
had been to pay any regard to the notice, for if we
had inquired at the farm, we could have got the
key of the little Museum-shed, and have seen
everything.  But how were we to know that?  I was not
able to go again until I most happily fell in with
the Pilgrimage of the Archæological Societies, and
was allowed to join it.
</p>

<p>
Corstopitum is 2½ miles south of the Roman Wall,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
and on the line of the Stanegate, of which its chief
street forms a part.  Dere Street crossed the river
here by a bridge of ten piers, and entered this site.
It seems that the importance of Corstopitum dates
from the time of Agricola, but was greatly increased
after the building of the Antonine Wall, 140 A.D., and
its most prosperous times were in that period.  It
probably depended for its protection chiefly on the
Wall and the Wall forts, being itself only a great
military store, covering 30 acres, of which 20 have
been excavated.
</p>

<p>
When I visited the excavations they had been
neglected for years owing to the war, and ragwort
and thistles had done their best to blot them out
again.  I could not help thinking of these beautiful
lines by Maude Egerton King:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Not bands, nor wheels, nor belching towers<br>
  Can break, or yoke,<br>
  Or blind with smoke<br>
  The vital powers,<br>
  So swift to spread their cloak<br>
  Of grassy forgiveness and sweet-scented stars<br>
  Over earth's man-made scars."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But on this particular occasion one wished that
nature had not been quite so busy in seeking to
heal the "scars" made by the excavators!
</p>

<p>
The granaries are magnificent buildings, strongly
buttressed to resist the pressure of the heavy stone
roofs, with floors raised on sleeper walls, and a
ventilation space below, to keep the corn both dry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
and cool.  Window-openings between the buttresses
admitted air under the floors.  In one window there
is a stone mullion, which is probably the only Roman
mullion now to be seen.  The original western
granary was evidently built before the eastern.
There are several levels of occupation in
Corstopitum, and the western granary has two floors,
two walls, two sets of drainage, one above the
other, whereas the eastern granary has only one
of each.  The heavy stone blocks of which they
are built are rusticated&mdash;inner surfaces as well as
outer.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the granaries are a public fountain and
watering-trough.  Other buildings found prove that
Corstopitum was an industrial centre of some
importance.
</p>

<p>
Two very valuable hoards of gold coins have been
found, one in 1908 and the other in 1911.  The
coins of the later find were the earlier and more
valuable, ranging from Nero to Antoninus Pius,
Hadrian's successor.  They have all been sent to
the British Museum.
</p>

<p>
The famous "Corbridge Lion" was found in a
tank in what was probably the garden of a house
in the settlement.
</p>

<p>
Amongst the interesting inscribed stones found
here is a tombstone in memory of Barathes of Palmyra
(in the Arabian desert), who was a standard-bearer
in the Roman army, and died at the age of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
sixty-eight.  A much finer tombstone, which he
dedicated to his wife, Regina, who only lived to be
thirty, is to be seen in the South Shields Museum,
having been found in that neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
The excavations at Corstopitum were carried
out, under the superintendence of Mr. R. H. Forster,
F.S.A., chiefly during the long vacations,
when Professor Haverfield and Dr. H. H. E. Craster
were able to be much on the spot, and Oxford
undergraduates could get an insight into the methods
of "reading the soil" employed by archæologists
in Britain.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="noindent" style="font-weight: bold">
HEXHAM.
</p>

<p>
Hexham is not a Roman site, but there are many
traces of the Roman occupation in the Abbey.
</p>

<p>
The Saxon crypt, almost the only remaining part
of the original church built by Bishop Wilfrid in
674, is entirely constructed of Roman stones.  The
workmen who built it have attached no importance
whatever to the beauty of the mouldings, nor to
the interest of the inscriptions.  They have simply
used them as a "key" for the plaster with which
walls and ceiling were covered.
</p>

<p>
A very beautiful olive-leaf-and-berry moulding
occurs frequently; there are also a cable pattern,
an elaborate fig-leaf design from a door-jamb, and
a deeply fluted column, all built up into the walls
of the crypt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
</p>

<p>
Two Roman inscriptions occur: one is on a stone
used as a flat roof-slab, and the other has had a
semi-circle cut out of it to form the head of a
door-way.
</p>

<p>
The flat roof-slab contained the names of Severus
and his two sons, but the name of Geta has been
erased as usual, by order of the brother who
murdered him.
</p>

<p>
The most interesting Roman stone at Hexham is
a tombstone with a vigorous carving of a Roman
soldier on horseback, carrying the standard, and
treading on his prostrate enemy.
</p>

<p>
The inscription reads:
</p>

<p>
"To the gods, the shades.  Flavinus, a soldier
of the cavalry regiment of Petriana, standard-bearer
of the troop of Candidus, being twenty-five
years of age, and having served seven years in the
army, is here laid."
</p>

<p>
Then there is an altar dedicated to Apollo
Maponus by Terentius Firmus, a native of Siena,
and prefect of the camps of the Sixth Legion.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bruce was of opinion that the Roman stones
in the Abbey were brought from Corstopitum&mdash;more
especially because, in the bed of the river near
Hexham, Roman stones abandoned in transit have
been found.
</p>

<p>
This view has been fully confirmed in recent
years.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent" style="font-weight: bold">
FROM GILSLAND TO BEWCASTLE.
</p>

<p>
Gilsland, with its green daisy-starred mounds,
its streams and glades and waterfalls, its Stepping-stones,
and Popping-stone, and Kissing-bush, and
generally romantic associations, is the greatest
possible contrast to the wild fells which we have so
lately left, but which can still be seen along the
eastern horizon.
</p>

<p>
The very name of Gilsland speaks of softness,
and verdure, and tinkling streams.
</p>

<p>
Here it was, so says history, that Sir Walter
Scott wooed and won his life-partner, and the
scenes of the different stages of his wooing are
pointed out with brazen assurance.
</p>

<p>
It therefore seemed most appropriate, when first
I visited Gilsland in a search for rooms, to be
mistaken for a member of a wedding-party, and to be
greeted with the words, "Ye're just in time to see
the bride!"
</p>

<p>
Gilsland was full of "the bride."  It was hopeless
to try and get any attention to business until she
had passed down the street on her father's arm,
amid whispers of, "It's <i>real</i> crêpe de chine,"&mdash;"Did
ye see how it's cut?" etc.
</p>

<p>
When I had finished my business, "the bride"
still pursued me.  I picked up a halfpenny, and
was looking round for some child who might have
dropped it, when the butcher at his shop door called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
out, "That's a looky ha'-penny, cast at the bride.
Ye'll be the next.  Ye must keep it."
</p>

<p>
There must be something in the very air of
Gilsland!
</p>

<p>
I had no intention of being "the next," so I gave
it to a small boy for his money-box, while the butcher
looked his disapproval.  It evidently was not "the
thing" to have done in sentimental Gilsland.
</p>

<p>
It was from Gilsland, later, that I visited
Bewcastle, and walked back along the Roman road
known as the Maiden Way.
</p>

<p>
Bewcastle is 11 miles from Gilsland, right away
across the Bewcastle Waste.
</p>

<p>
At first we could not get a car to take us, but
finally the butcher came to the rescue, and said
that if we did not mind the car in which he sent
round the meat, he would have it very thoroughly
cleaned.  It was easily convertible into a sort of
motor-waggonette, to hold six people, and was
really quite comfortable.  The only drawback was
that we caused great disappointment to all the
dogs of the villages we went through.  They recognized
the front of the vehicle, and the driver, and
came up wagging their tails, to receive a nasty
shock on finding that the contents of the rear
portion were human beings and not meat.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely run; past the ruin of Triermain
Castle, then to Askerton Castle, a beautiful old
Border fortification, which we stopped and viewed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
copying down two inscriptions, scratched, one on
the lead of the roof, and the other on the staircase.
The first was:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "Geo Taylr Novb 9th, 1745<br>
  the day that the rebels<br>
  Came to the Border."<br>
</p>

<p>
The other was:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "The familie Spoeller<br>
  refuge from to War<br>
  1914."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This reminds me of a Border story, connected
with Bewcastle, of a man, a "rough customer,"
who wanted to claim kinship with a Scotsman,
declaring that he was himself a "Border Scot."  "Gude
faith, I dinna doubt it," said the true Scot;
"the coarsest part of the cloth is aye at the border."
</p>

<p>
On we went, across the Bewcastle Waste, wild
and barren, till Bewcastle itself came into view,
with its church, its castle, and a few houses.
</p>

<p>
The church and castle are built on the site of a
Roman fort standing above the Kirkbeck Burn.
</p>

<p>
"Bueth's Castle" is the grimmest old ruin I
ever saw, with bare walls standing up in forbidding
sternness.
</p>

<p>
The church is said to date back to the Conquest.
There are four holes in the wall, through which
the dwellers in the castle used to keep watch against
their enemies.  It had till lately shown the beautiful
grey stone inside, but when we were there it had
just been distempered buff colour all over&mdash;stone
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
walls, stone columns, font, and all!  Fortunately
they had omitted to distemper the curiously carved
eighteenth-century tombstones in the churchyard,
and the Runic Cross!
</p>

<p>
This last is a magnificent example of early
Christian art amongst the Anglo-Saxons, with a
runic inscription which has been translated thus:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "This slender sign of victory set up<br>
  Hwaetred, Wothgaer, Olw-wolthu,<br>
  to Alcfrith, a king and son of<br>
  Oswy.  Pray for ..."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There are figures of Jesus Christ and of St. John
the Baptist; and also of King Alcfrith, whom it
commemorates, holding a hawk.  He is said to
have died of the yellow plague in 664 A.D.
</p>

<p>
There is very beautiful ornamental work on the
other three sides; vines, with birds and squirrels
in amongst the leaves, and elaborate interlacing
fret.
</p>

<p>
Three of us walked back from Bewcastle by the
Maiden Way; we kept losing the way and finding
it again; but we struck all the landmarks, and it
finally brought us out, "according to plan," just
above Birdoswald.  We passed Side Fell, the
highest point hereabouts, and came to the Beacon,
where the ruins of what was formerly supposed to
be a Roman watch-tower are quite unmistakable.
In Dr. Bruce's third edition there is a lovely picture
of it, with, prominently in the foreground, "a very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
human incident," as the newspapers love to say.
A brave, top-hatted cavalier, with umbrella raised
high above his head, is defending a clinging
companion in crinoline skirts from three meek-looking
cows, whose tails are curved like fish-hooks over
their backs!  What a romance lies hidden there!
When I saw it, I felt how much I had failed in not
peopling the solitudes of the Wall in my pictures!
But then, to me, the loneliness is half the charm,
and three-quarters of the character.  We crossed
Spadeadam Waste&mdash;such a fascinating name, which
takes us back to the very gates of Eden!&mdash;and we
came to Spadeadam farm-house, where an adamantine
old lady in a sunbonnet refused our appeal for
milk or tea.  Haymaking was in full swing, and she
really had more than she could do already, I am
sure.  Then we crossed the King Water, by stepping-stones,
and over the top of the next hill Gilsland
came into view.

<h3>
CONCLUSION
</h3>

<p>
And so I must take leave of the Wall; and
Wall must make its exit from this little
stage.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so,<br>
  And, being done, thus Wall away doth go."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>)<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It has not been possible within the limits of this
book to say all I should have liked.
</p>

<p>
The romance of the Museums I have left untouched,
with their pathetic relics of the loves, the
vanities, the hopes and fears, the sufferings, and the
victories of the great people who colonized our land
so many years ago.
</p>

<p>
There is abundant proof that there was some
measure of family life enjoyed by the Romans on
the wild outposts of the Wall.
</p>

<p>
The officers had their wives with them; children
were born (and lost); sorrowing husbands have
left memorials to their wives; disconsolate wives
lament, on stone, their husbands.
</p>

<p>
And trinkets there are in plenty: gold, and
silver, and bronze, inlaid with stones; and beautiful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
enamel work.  At Chesters there is a jet ring
inscribed with a monogram, and the legend:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  QVIS · SEPA · MEVM · ET · TVVM · DVRANTE · VITA<br>
  "Who shall separate me and thee during life?"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Has mankind changed much in eighteen hundred
years?
</p>

<p>
Only one definitely Christian inscription has been
found, and that is a British tombstone.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all the inscribed stones show signs of
having been purposely smashed; possibly by
"Christian" Britons, who thought later that by
that means they were doing God service.
</p>

<p>
It is so much easier to smash stones than to live
the Christian life!  No doubt the smashing was
sometimes a symbolic act, to indicate the renunciation
of the old pagan habits, and to remove temptation.
</p>

<p>
I was very sorry to take leave of the Wall;
perhaps even more sorry to take leave of the kindly
friends I had made.  I met with many instances of
the blunt outspokenness of the northern character,
but never with a spark of rudeness nor unpleasant
familiarity.
</p>

<p>
As I travelled south in the train, I remembered
what Hutton has said: that the Wall "would
exhibit its proud head many thousand years";
but that the mounds of the Vallum, "being native
earth, would continue to the last trump."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
</p>

<p>
Is this indeed so?  Is it, for example, possible
that the bunkers on the golf-links I was then
passing are the most enduring portion of our
civilization?  Will pilgrims in the far distant future
travel hundreds and thousands of miles to see these,
our only contemporary "earth-works," as to a
shrine, wondering what great chiefs are buried
under them?  It might be so, if "native earth"
were indeed the most enduring form of construction.
But I beg leave to doubt it.
</p>

<p>
Back in London, it seemed cold and dull at first.
I missed the freedom of the Wall, where every one I
met had said, "It's a gran' day, the day," as
naturally as they had smiled as we passed each other.
</p>

<p>
Ah! but London has a kind heart too, though
circumstances prevent her from wearing it on her
sleeve.  Many have testified to this in the past,
and will testify to it in the future.  And therefore in
London also there is much that we may surely count
amongst the "things that endure."
</p>

<p>
Old Londinium, older than the Romans, who
colonized and fortified but did not found her, is
dear to us, in spite of all her fog and smoke and
turmoil, for of her also it is true that
